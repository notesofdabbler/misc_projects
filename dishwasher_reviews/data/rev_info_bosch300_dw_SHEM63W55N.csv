A great dishwasher!,"We recently had to replace our old dishwasher from another manufacturer.  I had heard good things about Bosch dishwashers so wanted to to buy one as a replacement.  This new Bosch is the best ever!  It gets super hot and cleans so much better.  Also somehow it is even quieter then our old one, we can only tell it is on when we hear the drain.  Also really like the physical buttons on the front and countdown timer as it makes it easy to see the settings and know when it will be complete.

Dishwasher Standout,"This is one quiet dishwasher.  We love the delay setting so it pretty much runs after we go to bed.  That said, we can run it when we are watching TV and not be bothered by the sound.  After having installed 4 other makes of dishwashers I must say that this dishwasher was by far the easiest to install.  The leveling controls are simple and really well designed.  We are very pleased with the cleaning results of the dishwasher and yes, we do not have to rinse the dishes.  Simply put, we are impressed.

Surprisingly spacious,"We bought this Bosch 300 dishwasher to replace a 7 year old dishwasher. We researched various brands and Bosch kept being listed first in various categories. But we chose this particular model due to one important factor (for us), heated drying! Most Bosch dishwashers use a system of superheated rinse water, then ""pop"" the door and allow natural convection to dry the dishes. That would not cut it for us! From the initial cycle, this dishwasher has lived up to it's well deserved reputation. The dishes are clean, the pots and pans too. The automatic setting is what we use the most, but you may use alternative settings to clean too. The interior space is ample for loading large pots and the middle rack is adjustable for plates and bowls. The top rack has been a hidden gem, it allows you to place serving utensils and smaller items to be cleaned without slipping out of place when hit by a jet of water. The front controls are ok'd-school red LED, with countdown timer. A dedicated power button will keep it from accidentally starting up. My wife and I are very pleased with it!

Air dry feature is the BEST,While remodeling we replaced our 11-year-old Bosch with another Bosch of course. The old one worked just fine but didn't match. I have to say how much I love this new washer. Three racks are perfect. It keeps lids in place.The auto air feature is exactly what I need. Improved rack layout holds more dishes than before. Cleans.

Love my new Dishwasher,I did a lot of research for over six months to find the perfect dishwasher in my price range. I need up choosing this one and I do not regret my decision at all. It is so quiet I can't even tell if it's running or not. My dishes come out perfectly clean no matter which cycle are use. This dishwasher holds so many more dishes than my 10-year-old GE. Are used to have to run my dishwasher every day and I can go almost 3to 4 days without running it. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.],100,"August 10, 2020"

Crack above front control panel,"I purchased this in Jan. with an extended warranty. There is now a crack in the stainless above the control panel and the rinse aid leaks.

Great dishwasher!,"We replaced our old leaking dishwasher with a Samsung.  It was so bad we returned after 4 months and ordered this Bosch model.  The first one we had to refuse delivery because the outter insulation pad was soaking wet and dripping all over the floor.  After many phone calls we got the replacement Bosch.  It works amazingly compared to the Samsung.  I definitely recommend this model.  I just wish we had a better purchasing experience.  We are a family of 5 and we run our dishwasher daily, especially during Quarantine.  I think some days we could run it twice!  We definitely put household appliances to the test.

Why would a purchase come without an electrical cord? weird. After paying AGAIN to have it installed, it didn't dry dishes, and smelled inside, left food at bottom. The instructions were so difficult to understand due to mismatched diagrams, no instructions how to operate, had to finally call in, was then met by a very annoyed lady (I wasn't rude or anything, i just think she didn't like her on call job since it was after 5pm PST when I called), she couldn't explain how to operate, was frustrated, then said, give it some time to run a few times in order to dry the dishes. End result=if you want your dishes dry you have to add on that function which will add on another 40 min to the cycle. Really? Almost 3 hours to run the sanitize cycle?

Pro it’s very easy to install, I Am a woman I installed it myself, extremely quiet, cons dishes remain ridiculously wet and it was a super tight squeeze to get under cabinet. You can install it no problem if there is already an electrical outlet under cabinet next to washer cabinet from prior dishwasher. It comes with all extra parts you don’t need to purchase anything additional. I recommend you run it before sliding it into cabinet to check for leaking water. Super tight squeeze, (see pictures) I have an older home under cabinet is extract minimum space required. I am replacing floor soon so I was able to cut some flooring out in front of dishwasher cabinet space (see pictures) to drop it down low enough to slide under counter. There is a lip on the back side so I had to slightly tip it to get under counter edge(see pictures). I used two wide butcher knives between insulation and counter top (see picture)to reduce insulation bunching up as I slid dishwasher under cabinet. BIG flaw dishes remain VERY VERY WET (see picture) this is not what I expected. I ran it on extra dry, dishes are MORE WET than when I hand wash and rinse in hot water. I’ll try the sanitize cycle next hoping that will fix the problem. I will update if I resolve the LACKING ABILITY TO DRY dishes problem.",80,"April 25, 2020"

In These Times: A Great Relief,"Our new dishwasher, the 300 series, is a lifesaver in these times of coronavirus. We replaced our old dishwasher which was at least 20 years old a few months ago.Our new dishwasher, the 300 series, is a lifesaver in these times of coronavirus. We replaced our old dishwasher which was at least 20 years old a few months ago. It was such a dilapidated machine, and so noisy, that we were reluctant to use it at all. Then we were so lucky to get this dishwasher. I can't believe how quiet it is. When I first ran it, I couldn't believe that it was running. I had to put my ear against the door. The first load that I washed was an eye-opener. A glass that I had assumed would be forever cloudy had miraculously become crystal-clear. I was ecstatic. Nowadays, most of our food is prepared at home. That generates so many dirty dishes every single day. But no problem!

Silent Performance,"We recently selected all new appliances for our newly constructed home which features a large open area for the kitchen, eating area, and living room.

"Bosch, if you want them clean!","My third bosch.  This one replaced a non-Bosch dishwasher that was only 3 years old.  I'd had a service guy work on it about a year ago (when it was only 2 years old).  They charged me nearly the cost of a new machine to replace the motherboard.  A year later it was dead again.  This time I did what I should have done the first time, gotten a Bosch.  Install was a breeze.  It worked right from day one and has never failed to clean completely whatever dirty dishes I've put into it.  Clean, wicked hot dry, quiet, energy efficent.

One I had installed in one home and had no issues and has been great and the second I bought from Home Depot and is sitting in the corner of my new home because it has not been installed and cannot be returned (48 hour return policy). The features that stand out most about this Bosch are: cleans really well, very quiet, dependable and stylish appearance. I have owned the old one for a year and the new one for 10 days -- not sure how well the new one works yet because no one has installed it (despite paying). I would not say it meets expectations because I paid for a dishwasher that would be installed and wash dishes and did not receive that product and I cannot use the dishwasher with it sitting in the corner uninstalled.

I don't really think that reviewing a product when it is so new is the best idea since you haven't experienced it long enough to give a accurate review.  I have tried to wait and then do reviews but usually the link won't work it you wait so I'll review what I know.  So far it has been great compared to the Maytag which I only kept 9 months.  I like the quietness, ability to clean, front controls, utensil & flatware rack, adjustable top rack, the countdown time, adjustable tines.  There are 2 of us and I wash dishes every other day.   The racks design still needs work.  If I place dinner plates, mixing bowls cookware on the bottom then the upper rack must be up and then cereal/soup bowls, saucers, mugs, drinking glasses won't fit.  And then of course the reverse is true.  I have left the basket out to give me more room and that helps but the non-movable tines limit what you can place on the bottom rack.  Drying is good.  Doesn't dry plastic or anything that will hold water (like bottom of cups).  The design of the upper rack is challenging to try to get cups, glasses, sauces, small bowls or plastic ware to fit in it.   So far I like this dishwasher and would recommend it as a best choice available today.",100,"February 15, 2020"
Impressive,"This is my 2nd bosch dishwasher. My first one was sold with my previous home bit it was 5 years old and very used with a family of 4 who 2 of thosewere young children.  This washer has the best cycle time and will clean all plates and dry 99% of the water off. Quiet easy to operate. The 3 tier rack is very nice idea. wash all utensils on top , remove the utensils container on bottom shelf and poof more room for dishes. We did our research and after owning a few other brands , we are convinced this in the best manufacture of dish washers. The perticular model best fit our budget and couldnt be happier.

Bosch SHEM63W55N!,"I have had this dishwasher for 5 months now and I am very happy with its performance! It can accumulate a few days of dishes at times. It does hold a lot of dishes. I didnt think I would like the 3rd rack but I do like it for the flatware now that I got used to it. I mostly use the Auto cycle, it washes flawlessly. This machine is very quiet but very powerful. I use rinseaid (jetdry) as suggested! It will tell me on the console when to add more jetdry. I wish it would let me know before it actually before it runs out so I am not pressed to add it just when I am starting a new cycle! I am also pleased with the drying performance. I have read so many complaints about the drying but those people probably arent using the jetdry! I had been using cascade platinum pods because I was stocked with it! Since I ran out I followed the Bosch recommendation and am currently using finish quantum pods. Both are really good but I do find the Cascade will shile the pots and flatware just a bit better! I also have soft water and I dont know if that has anything to do with it! Can Bosch give me a explination as to why they recommend Finish? I also forgot to mention I have my rinse aid set at low #2 because I am in a soft water area! I also wish Bosch would have given a better loading diagram because I use a few cutting boards at a time as well as odd shaped corning ware. I do manage to get everything in however! 
I give this dishwasher a 5 Star. I would like to hear back from Bosch on my comments. It took me a long time to get to this review because I run the machine 2 to 4 times a week, so I really wanted to test it out! [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]",100,"January 28, 2020"

After extensive and somewhat obsessive analysis of reviews both here at Home Depot and on Consumer Reports, I almost didn't buy this because of some common themes the negative reviews had. A sale and a coupon convinced me to take a leap however, and my fears have been so far unfounded and after about a month of use, this dishwasher works far better than any previous dishwasher I've ever had. 

As the first dishwasher I've ever installed, I can only advise to read the instructions, and if in doubt or they don't make sense at the time, follow them anyway, and it will become clear once you do what it says.  

Now to address some of the complaints previous purchasers have mentioned.  First off, the lack of a heating element to dry the dishes seems to cause some people problems, and frankly it was hard for me to get my head around the idea.  I've now tried all the cycles and all of them seem to work very well, even the 60 minute fast cycle (which is only for lightly soiled dishes, by the way).  The default cycle is Auto, without the Extra Dry option turned on, which uses an optical sensor to see how dirty the water is and adjusts the run time accordingly.  That is the one I use most, but there will be a little water left on top of cups if they aren't tilted, but that was the same with my old dishwasher.  With Extra Dry on, there isn't even that, and even plastic is dry unless you have something turned up the wrong way.  

So what's the secret?  Let the dishwasher do it's job the way it is designed to do it, and don't mess with it until it's done.  That means after it's finished washing, which is 2 hours 9 minutes on Auto with no other options (2:30 with Extra Dry on), LEAVE IT ALONE.  Do NOT open the door and let the steam out like some have said.  In fact, I usually let it sit for another 2 hours for good measure.  After that, put away your very clean and very dry dishes.  There is a heating element that super heats the final rinse water to heat up the dishes, which then causes the water to condense on the stainless tub and is then pulled off the dishes. Letting the steam out defeats the purpose, and opening the door too soon interrupts the process. 

Also, the use of a rinse aid like Jet Dry is a requirement for this dishwasher to work as it is designed.  

Second, there were some complaints about the display staying on, flimsy doors, etc.  The manual tells you how to reprogram a lot of settings and turn them on or off.  You can even alter the amount of rinse aid that gets dispensed, how long the display stays on after it finishes, and more.  As far as the door being flimsy - if you take it and try and flex it without the dishwasher being attached, it does seem a bit flimsy.  For comparison, I tried flexing my 20 year old Kenmore dishwasher door after I pulled it out, and it was even more flimsy - and it probably weighed less than this Bosch.

This is NOT a dishwasher for you if you are in a hurry, but if you work with it instead of against it, it works fantastic. I can probably put 50% more in this dishwasher than my previous one, and have even put in some really baked on and dried on food dishes, and it works amazingly well.  The adjustable top rack and the utensil tray are fantastic options, and I just removed the regular utensil caddy from the bottom rack entirely and only use the top tray now.

The only negatives were a minor scorched rubber smell when you open the door that has slowly dissipated over the past month, and there was a tiny scratch on the door when I unpacked it - which I simply fixed with a tiny touch of white enamel paint; you can't even tell it was ever there.  

Oh, and this thing is so quiet, I had to put my ear against the door to even tell if it was spraying.  There is a very low faint hum that comes from it that may bother some people sensitive to low frequencies, but that's a stretch, and could be affected by the flooring it is installed on.  Sorry for the long review, but I hope it helps someone with making a choice.",100,"November 12, 2019"

It does a good job of making dishes shine but I put in clean dishes.  (Why? I wouldn't put garbage in a sink full of dishwater, either.)  It isn't easy to figure out the best placement for the varied sizes of plates and bowls. I also can't figure out how to fill rinse dispenser as it seems to leak out as I pour it in. I still have to call Bosch about that. 

The unit did not fit particularly well into same space occupied by three previous dishwashers. Installers didn't really care, and left a required new outlet box on floor of the cabinet under the sink instead of screwing it to wall, where it would have fit. 

Neither the side trim nor kick plate covers gaps between walls of dishwasher space, especially below the door hinge. The kick plate is small and installed with black screws although the appliance and plate are white.  Other Bosch dishwashers seem to have plates that click on the dishwasher, but that wasn't something I would or could have checked when I ordered it yes 

I went to Home Depot with pictures in evening after install. They said they'd contact the installer to correct issues.  The sales person followed up with a reassuring phone call the next day but it's been a week and we've heard nothing else. That's probably ok since we don't want Mario and Luigi trying to fix their own work.",60,"August 16, 2019"
Very Satisfied with Bosch 300 Series Dishwasher,"This seems to be a very nice dishwasher; it operates very quietly and has given us no problem in the 6 weeks we have had it.

Very Satisfied with Bosch 300 Series Dishwasher,"This seems to be a very nice dishwasher; it operates very quietly and has given us no problem in the 6 weeks we have had it.

Pros:
-Easy installation (as long as you have space in the adjacent cabinet for the power junction box)
-Clear instructions
-Extremely quiet operation
-Straightforward controls with real buttons
-Good capacity and flexibility for arranging the dishes and cutlery
-The third upper rack is pretty handy for small items
-Racks seem sturdy--moreso that a lot of other models I looked at--with good coating
-Nice aesthetics and thoughtful design
Cons:
-Leaves quite a bit of residual water unless you use the Extra Dry or Sanitize wash options
-Can get somewhat smelly in between washes (the quick rinse feature helps with this)
-The need to use a rinse agent per instructions is something I've never had to do this with any dishwasher I've used in the past
-Somewhat expensive--I think I could have been just as happy with the slightly louder Bosch model that doesn't have the third rack which was a couple hundred less--but if it lasts, the extra initial outlay will have been long forgotten.
-I was fortunate that the adjacent base cabinet had *just* enough space to mount the power junction box behind the drawers--I can imagine this requirement could complicate some installations.",100,"June 6, 2019"

I test ran it before pushing it into the cabinet and it was quieter than than our old one and we can barely tell its on now that it is in the cabinet. I bought Bosh because of the Aquastop leak detection system as i am in the process of replacing my wood floors from the previous dishwashers leak. This dishwasher has an ""ON?OFF"" button which is a bit confusing to me as none of my other kitchen appliances have this. The top band of the appliance which contains the handle is plastic across the entire width of the unit which i am disappointed about.. Installation was a challenge near the end (I installed myself) because the feet on the front are difficult to rotate even with no weight on them and there is no space for a tool (to work around this lower the feet to be flush with the bottom of the unit prior to install within the cabinet.). Also, if you want to INSTALL YOURSELF have it DELIVERED ON A WEEK DAY, because the Bosch INSTALLATION HELP LINE IS ONLY OPEN MONDAY - FRIDAY. That said, if I needed install assistance or if my unit was broken it would have to be reported to the manufacturer, THEREFORE ITS BETTER TO HAVE HOME DEPOT INSTALL IT SO IF SOMETHING GOES WRONG IN THE FIRS 24-48 HRS HOME DEPOT HAS TO FIX IT. I wish the Home Depot sales lady would have told me both of those things.",80,"April 28, 2019"

I wish the top rack would adjust easier, it can be difficult to maneuver.

It has strangely-angled tines. The photos in the instructions don't do a good job of illustrating how to load the bottom rack dishes with the oddly angled tines.I can't tell from the official Bosch You tube videos, either. The dishes can be slanted two ways, and one way angles them upward. If I slant them downward, they tend to ""clamshell."" 

Better illustrations in the instructions would be helpful.

"I rarely write product reviews, but I feel compelled to this time because you NEED TO KNOW how gr...","I rarely write product reviews, but I feel compelled to this time because you NEED TO KNOW how great this dishwasher is. Disclaimers: I might have been more blown away because prior to installing this, I dealt with a dishwasher-less kitchen for 18 months, but I am well familiar with dishwashers, having had the luxury of one for 95% of my entire life. Also, we've been using it for about three weeks at this juncture, so the longevity of it is not something I can address yet.

In any case, from a looks perspective - of course, it's beautiful. I bought the white front-control one because I like white appliances, but in the store, the other colors were just as attractive.

All of its claims are true. I have found that you truly do not need to rinse the dishes. I have never pulled a dish out that was dirty. In fact, I tested the lengths of what it can do yesterday when I put a peanut butter-covered butter knife in there without getting the peanut butter off first. I put it in the top rack, and it was spotless when I pulled it out. I have never encountered that before.

It is so quiet, that sometimes we cannot tell when it is running. It is very water and electricity efficient. It does a really decent job of drying the dishes due to the stainless steel tub. If you upgrade to glass tupperware even better.

My fiance and I were talking the other day and we both were like, why would anyone even spend additional money on the more expensive models? This one is the best, so if you're a little hesitant to buy the 300, know that from my perspective, I can't imagine it doing anything any better.",100,"April 7, 2019"
Love it!,"After searching and reading reviews to buy my first dishwasher I decided to get this Bosch, it’s been about two months using it and so far I love it.

"Great features, so quiet, clean dishes!","We updated our kitchen in March. Originally we we were planning on a different different brand, so glad we went with Bosch. This dishwasher has a stainless steel tub, it is more durable than our previous two dishwashers. It has a lot of features that we have not even used all of them yet. The biggest selling point for us was the utensil rack on the top. It is awesome. No stupid basket to deal with or take up space. The second rack is adjustable. We had some taller glasses and it was easy to lower the rack to make the fit. It is so quiet, you need to open the door to see if it is running. We really love this dishwasher.

Bought this dishwasher to replace 10-year-old Bosch that was having serious issues. I installed i...,"Bought this dishwasher to replace 10-year-old Bosch that was having serious issues. I installed it myself (as I did the original), not quite plug-n-play as the new Bosch comes with an electrical junction box you have to mount under the sink, connecting the household wiring to the Bosch-provided appliance plug. I mistakenly forgot to remove the water line adapter from the old unit before they hauled it off, so had to buy another (few bucks at local hardware). Also had an issue adjusting the leveling ""foot"" at the rear of the dishwasher that you raise and lower via a threaded control in the front after the dishwasher is installed under the cabinet, either mine maxed out before I got the unit perfectly level or something is funky with my cabinet or floor (entirely possible!). But it's close enough that it looks fine.

Operationally, it's similar to the old Bosch but with some noticeable differences. Definitely quieter. Also makes different types of noises and seems to have more complex cycles. I typically use the AUTO setting, which takes about 2.5 hours. Tried the 60 minute setting also (the short cycle on the old Bosch was 30 minutes). Dishes come out clean. We're using Ecover powder, just switched after having issues with previous brand. 

Stainless interior is very nice. Racks seem to hold more than the old Bosch. Huge silverware holder. Comes with a third rack that goes in the very top, haven't used that one yet.

Seems like a solid unit. Time will tell. So far so good. Will give it a good cleaning with LemiShine dishwasher cleaner once a month, that really seems to help with odors, accumulated mineral deposits, general grime, and clogged spray arms.",100,"October 30, 2018"
I have owned and used the Bosch 300 series tall tub dishwasher with front control for just over f...,"I have owned and used the Bosch 300 series tall tub dishwasher with front control for just over five weeks now, and so far I'm impressed and satisfied with its performance. The features I like the most are that it's very quiet at 44 dB. You can hardly hear it running. According to a chart I found, most dishwashers have a dB rating of 75-80; the silverware basket with its odd-size openings, which is great for inserting my thick-handled silverware; the hidden handle on the door; no more stick-out door handle (which admittedly was useful for hanging a hand towel, however, I found a suction-cup hook on the door holds a hand towel just as well); and the magnetic surface of the door. I'm not sure if it's the fact that its magnetic, but it doesn't tend to collect water droplets. On two previous stainless steel dishwashers I owned, the stainless steel (non-magnetic) doors tended to collect water droplets (from accidental sprayings from the kitchen faucet since the dishwasher is located right next to the sink) which caused streaky runs, which over time caused discoloration of the stainless steel surface. I have noticed that has not been happening with the door on this dishwasher, which is definitely a plus for me. 
As far as the dishwashing performance, I'm satisfied. Sure, there have been a few occasions where some dishes (mostly large utensils in the 3rd uppermost rack) didn't get entirely clean, possibly due to the fact that I didn't position them correctly, but for the most part my dishes have come out sparkling clean and dry. It is recommended to use rinse aid at all times, which helps to leave dishes spot-free as well as improves drying performance. The control panel will light up when more rinse aid needs to be added, so the dishwasher never has to run out of this. Bosch also recommends using the Finish brand of dishwasher detergent. 
There are four main programs: Heavy, Auto, Normal, and Speed60, and several extra options, which are Rinse (for pre-rinsing dishes, useful if dirty dishes sit in the dishwasher for several hours and to reduce odors) Delay Start, Sanitize (for baby bottles, chopping boards, canning jars, etc.), Half-Load (for smaller, lightly soiled loads; uses less water), and Extra-Dry. Be mindful that the Sanitize and Extra-Dry options increase program cycle time and also use more energy. 
The control panel is easy to operate with light push buttons (not touch control). The digital display is in bright red, which I find a bit garish (light blue or green would've been preferable), but fortunately this is only visible when the dishwasher is turned on and running. 
The third rack is useful for placing large cooking tools and serving utensils which don't really fit in the silverware basket, unless you flip up the lid, or you can use this rack to place silverware instead of/or in addition to using the silverware basket . The middle rack is can be lowered or raised with the Rackmatic function, and it also has small cup shelves (which can be folded up) as well as foldable flip tines. The bottom rack also has foldable flip tines. 
The dishwasher comes with a very detailed instruction booklet. Of course, it includes a section on care and maintenance as well as troubleshooting. The dishwasher comes with a 365 day warranty from the date of purchase and includes defects in materials and workmanship. 
I had my dishwasher installed professionally and the process seemed to be problem-free for the installers. Be aware that because Bosch is a European brand, this dishwasher comes with a separate electrical supply junction box. So it doesn't plug directly into your outlet, it first plugs into the junction box which is then plugged into a standard 120v outlet. It is recommended that this junction box be attached in an accessible cabinet next to your dishwasher, not behind the dishwasher itself.",100,"September 8, 2018"

In my 2 bed condo I don’t even notice it’s running. Top tray for big spoons is very useful. I buy the recommended pods.
Bought it from Reston,VA store. Mac is a great guy, he said he was not from Appliances section but very knowledgeable, explained all well, took my order and scheduled installation effeciently. Very customer oriented.

"There are places on the internet that really dis Bosch dishwashers, so I wanted to write a review...","There are places on the internet that really dis Bosch dishwashers, so I wanted to write a review of my experience, which is all positive.  This is the second Bosch dishwasher I have had, so my experience is not just with this one.  

I think the criticism comes from 1) customers who get a dishwasher that doesn't work, or breaks down soon after installation and 2) customers who want the dishwasher to perform like the noisy, energy-inefficient models that existed in previous years.  Bosch has certain goals with their product that may not agree with what other manufacturers produce.  My needs match what Bosch manufactures.

Above all, this is the quietest dishwasher I have ever had, even quieter than the more expensive Bosch I had before.  After sweating out a lengthy and difficult installation (not related to the dishwasher but to my particular situation in the kitchen), I loaded it up and turned it on with dirty dishes.  I was frustrated and angry that the dishwasher did not appear to be working.  The dishwasher that was replaced (not a Bosch) made all kinds of sounds (spraying water, clicks in the control mechanism, pump noises) and I used this to determine if the dishwasher was running.  After pushing buttons and cursing for several hours, I finally determined that the Bosch I had just installed was indeed working!  It was so quiet that I simply could not hear it.

Without modifying the controls set out of the box, dishes do have a slight moisture on them.  I don't have any problem with this at all, and I know that I am saving $$$ by not having an extended drying period at the end.  This can be reset, and I am experimenting with that now.

In that first load I put in some dishes that had dried on ketchup and mustard, peanut butter, dried coffee stains, etc., and all came out perfectly clean.  Magic!

In reviews on other sites, I heard tell of the fact that the water connection on the dishwasher was some weird type that the individual installing could not find a matching fitting for.  So, I ordered the installation kit.  In fact, the supply tubing they supplied had the same fittings as every other dishwasher in the universe, a 3/8"" fine pitch type used on your standard supply valve.  It appears this is a non-issue.

I did have one slight issue with the installation kit I purchased.  The tubing is about 6' long, and I needed about 8'.  Rather than purchasing a longer supply hose, I simply used a 2' piece of copper tubing I had to extend the supply hose across the back of the dishwasher, terminating at the right back corner.  The flexible hose then continued to the outlet under the sink, and gave me the flexibility I needed to get the dishwasher in and out during installation.

At this point, I have no complaints whatsoever.  This is a beautiful dishwasher, even though it is in the mid-range of their models.",100,"August 23, 2018"
Unique and Quiet,"Unlike any other dishwasher I've ever seen (but I really don't get out much... just kidding!) I've installed more than my fair share of dishwashers in my time but this was a new experience. The entire machine including all the components normally visible underneath are in an entirely sealed enclosure. I assume this is to help reduce noise. 

Because of this, the power and water supply connections are at the rear (see photos) which I thought was convenient until I discovered this presented some installation challenges which might require drilling new holes in the cabinet side wall and some electrical circuit juggling since power must be connected using their supplied proprietary cord and junction box... if the existing wiring (receptacle or hard wire cable) is in the dishwasher cavity it will have to be rerouted out into the adjacent cabinet to be connected to the supplied junction box which will in turn send the power back to the washer with its special plug. There simply isn't enough room in most dishwasher cutouts for their junction box. Checking for water connection leaks is also challenging since once the dishwasher is installed the water line connection is absolutely not visible because of the sealed enclosure. For the first few days I left the front skirt off the front bottom so I could check for the presence of water seeping out. No problems so far so I'm confident all is good.

Machine has only three leveling feet... two in the front and one in the rear middle. The two front feet are individually adjustable but once the machine is level, a special screw located between the two feet can raise or lower the front of the machine without disturbing the relationship set by the individual adjustments... someone burned midnight oil dreaming this up.

Too many features to list them all so here are some highlights:
• RackMatic – An adjustable upper rack with three different height levels
• 24/7 AquaStop – A redesigned base meant to contain leaks, complete with a sensor and pump that will shut down the dishwasher and drain water if a leak should occur at any time, not just when the dishwasher is in use
• New 3rd Rack – All Bosch dishwashers get a 3rd rack, and they've been tweaked to fit more than just silverware
• Speed60 Cycle – A quick cycle that's designed to clean and dry in about an hour (a few models feature a less-intense half-hour Clean30 cycle for less-soiled dishes)
• ExtraDry – Raises temperatures during the drying phase for improved moisture evaporation... I did discover that if you simply leave the door closed until the machine cools off (might be a few hours if you have the time) using the standard cycles the dishes will be much drier due to the evaporative style of drying this machine uses unlike most other types of dishwashers for which opening the door when the cycle ends results in air-drying to speed things up
• FlexSpace Tines – Most 300 Series dishwashers have a redesigned adjustable tine format for easier loading of thicker dishes, including adjustable tines on both the upper and lower racks.
• EasyGlide Wheels – Both upper and lower racks slide in and out more smoothly

This washer replaced a 15 year old Whirlpool that I had quite a few problems with over the years. Replaced two main boards on it as well as the heating element. Luckily, I'm a big DYI-er, so I was able to replace them myself saving tons of $$ for labor. First off, I must say, Bosch has AMAZING customer service. After ordering this dishwasher, I received two separate calls from Bosch letting me know the details on how/when my new dishwasher will be delivered and installed. Very kind. Comforting to know in the event I need to contact them in the future. Second, the installation co. was courteous, professional, reliable and efficient. The first thing I noticed after running the dishwasher for the first time was that it's SUPER quiet! After pressing the START button, I literally could not hear the water filling into the tank. Very strange at first. I actually pressed the Stop button, and then started it again to make sure it was actually running. WOW! After the load finished, I was quite pleased with the cleaning results. So far, we've done about 4 full loads using Finish brand Quantum packs. The dishes come out clean and smelling fresh each time. I've noticed (like my old washer) that it's best to use the Extra Dry setting if you want glasses and plastic storage containers to come out more dry after the cycle is done. -- which I'm fine with. The drawers have a good amount of room for dishes, and I love how the height of the top rack can be adjusted up/down a few inches to compensate for taller glasses. It also has a slim rack above that which is great for flat items like additional silverware or larger cooking spoons. The buttons are ""push-button"" style, which I prefer much more over the ""touch"" display type. Initially, I was thinking that the timer indicator was showing long washing times (2+ hours), but recently discovered that the timer includes the drying time as well, so the actual wash time is only about 1.5 hours - if that. I'm very happy so far. Functionality, operation, ease of use, etc. Another big plus is that it looks absolutely beautiful in our kitchen. Very nice ""flush-mount"" design and the stainless finish looks durable and sleek. Give this one a try. It would be hard to say anything negative about it. After all, it is a ""Bosch."" From what I hear, they are the best in the biz when it comes to dishwashers. Looking forward to having this one for many years to come.",100,"July 30, 2018"

I also decided to try out how well it would wash really dirty dishes by placing some more difficult to wash items in the tub, and it completed the job without any issues. Five stars from this mother of 3 dragons and hater of dishes.

The detergent receptacle closes easily. There was no remaining detergent or residue after the cycle completed. 

The Bosch is very easy to operate and self explanatory. There is little noise while it is in operation and, therefore, does not contribute to the low roar that is already happening in the kitchen with a busy family.

Pure Garbage,"Every time we need to use it, we have to reset it & cross our fingers, that it completes a complete cycle. Contacted Home Depot as soon as we started having problems & they said they have a 48-hour window, to accept returns, so too bad, because they won't stand behind the JUNK, that they sell, regardless of us buying the service plan. Called the factory & they gave us some dummy's phone number, which took a week, to get around to showing up. Then he said I didn't read the directions, on how to reset it, if it gives us problems, which I told him we were already doing this, because the auto sensor mode, doesn't work, so we are FORCED to have to reset it, to use the normal selection EVERY TIME, and cross our fingers & hope it completes that cycle because it won't let me select ANY cycle, without having to reset it. The mechanic wouldn't even stick around to watch it cycle, so we are basically SCREWED!!",20,"November 20, 2020"

This model seems smaller in size, I removed the cutlery basket on the bottom rack to make more room . I use the top third rack for cutlery and small utensils. It's very quiet when it's running , but when it's draining it's very loud . The red info light that's supposed to show on the kitchen floor never worked from day one . Cleaning is ok , I was expecting better performance for a dishwasher of this brand and cost , and I do use Finish detergent and rinse aid .Overall I'd give it an 7.5 /10 [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]",60,"November 9, 2020"

"This dishwasher replaced an 11 year old Bosch dishwasher, which...","This dishwasher replaced an 11 year old Bosch dishwasher, which was leaving a film on the dishes.  It turned out the problem was not the dishwasher, but our water softener, which had stopped working.  So it turns out we replaced it prematurely.  The new dishwasher was also leaving a film until we figured out the problem with the water softener.  Water softener was fixed, and now the dishwasher works perfectly.  We always run the cycles with Extra Dry, and do not have a problem with dishes getting adequately dry (but not perfectly dry).  One criticism I have is that the cutlery basket is very large, thus taking up a lot of space.  Our previous Bosch had a basket that was in two pieces, so you could choose to use just one piece and save space.  With the third top rack, we find the basket is superfluous, so we do not use it, or we use the smaller one saved from the prior dishwasher.  Lesson learned- water quality, i.e. softness, plays a significant role in dishwasher functioning.  If I had hard water and no softener, I would choose a dishwasher that had the ability to accept salt for softening.",100,"October 28, 2020"
Extra dry always required,"This dishwasher is very quiet and seems to run very smoothly. Dishes are clean, but are only dry if the Extra Dry feature is selected.

Myonly critique is the front panel and the racks feel flimsy.
Our old K-A was built much sturdier as far as feel when opening the door or sliding the racks in and out.
with that said i dont feel its totally worth the 850.00 i paid but as long as it keeps working and doing the job well after the warranty period.
Was really hoping the Bosch brand would stomp all over KA and WP but we will see.
In all it meets all that i require to do, i just think some padding behind the front SS panel would feel sturdier as well as better rack tracks.

Like a Charm,"This dishwasher has been our favorite one to date. It gets the job done, very well and every time. It is dependable and I know the dishes will come out looking sparkling after each load. I would highly recommend! [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]",100,"October 20, 2020"
Really like it but...,"I really like this dishwasher as far as functionality. It holds a large load and is extremely quiet. The third shelf is an awesome feature and allows me to place items like carving knives, can caps and spatulas etc in there for cleaning. I have yet to use all the features in the month that I have had it but navigation thus far is simple. My only issue thus far is the after smell!!  It can just stink.  I’m not sure if it is because it is so well insulated that I can feel the interior is still warm the next day after running a load, or what is causing the malodor but the reek is taking some getting used to. And since reviews from two years ago mention this smell issue, well I’d think they should have resolved the problem by now.  Thus my middle of the road overall rating.",60,"October 20, 2020"
Bosch Dishwashers are the best!,"This dishwasher cleans all of my silverwear and dishes spotless everytime!

Dishes Come Out Sparkling Clean,"We couldn't be happier with our new Bosch dishwasher. We use the ""Speed60"" setting, which runs for 1 hr 10 min, with regular liquid detergent and no rinse aid. Dishes and glasses come out sparkling clean.  

We always run the dishwasher in the evening and then open it a little to let the dishes dry overnight. 

And did I mention this thing is QUIET!!  Even when the air gap (internal) is working.

One other thing, the location of the filter makes it easy to clean on a regular basis. 

There was one small glitch right after install. The wash setting was stuck on ""Auto"" and no matter what I did, I could not select a different setting. The ""Auto"" setting runs for over 2 hours and I found it wasn't necessary to get dishes clean. I googled and pressing the start button for 5 sec reset the unit. So far, the issue has not recurred.

"Dishwasher lasted for a few years, but failed in a big way","I had this dishwasher for five years, the dispenser failed at 3 years and at 5 a leak appeared at the bottom of the washer. Many parts were replaced including the inlet valve, hoses, and drain line. Nothing helped, as it turns out the stainless tub was leaking. It is spot welded with an elastomer seal in between and when this leaks there is no way to fix this, including rewelding. So despite the ""heavy duty"" stainless interior appearance, it becomes a boat anchor after a few years.",40,"October 13, 2020"
Don't waste your money! Bosch is the worst.,"I bought this dishwasher 13 months ago, I spent over $1000 including installation. It has stopped draining and gives the error message E24 (draining problem, no kidding). There is standing water and it is unusable. I had a plumber over twice today to snake the drain, it still won't drain. The problem is the pump inside the dishwasher, it won't pump the water out to drain. Bosch's customer service website is down, ""under maintenance,"" and when you call customer service, a recording says there is an unusually high call volume and you are told to CALL BACK LATER. Unbelievable. I thought Bosch was supposed to be a good premium brand, it is not. Don't waste your money on this garbage. I am furious.",20,"October 12, 2020"
Great dishwasher!,We are so happy with our new Bosch. Cleans beautifully with no noise. I would buy another Bosch in a heartbeat [This review was collected as part of a promotion.],100,"October 12, 2020"
Surprised me,"So I knew Bosch had a reputation for making great dishwashers.  However we bought one of their cheaper models, so I wasn't sure if their reputation would follow to their lower end stuff.  I am pleased to say it does.  Things that would require hand scrubbing on our old dishwasher just straight up get clean in the Bosch.  I really like the top rack for the utinsils.  I wasn't sure if it would be that big of a deal, but it's handy being able to seperate them into the slots and know they will get clean.  Putting them in the bins on the bottom shelf in our old dishwasher meant that some would clump together, and not get clean.  The only gripe I have is that after a month or two, the bottom rack started falling down out of the rails inside the washing machine.  This obstructed the bottom sprayer, and the dishes wouldn't get cleaned.  It was also a pain to pull the rack out since it wasn't on the rails.  We put in a support ticket, and the repair man was prepared to order us a new rack as the washer rails themselves looked fine and the walls weren't bowed.  However, it occurred to him that we might be able to bend the wheel holders on the rack itself some.  He did so, and now it's a great fit and we haven't had a single issue since.  So if anyone ends up with this same problem, that's a super easy thing to try.  Everything else has been golden, and I'd be happy to reccomend to anyone else the same purchase.  Well worth the cost.

First Dishwasher,"I bought this dishwasher for my wife for Christmas. It is her first dishwasher and she was so thrilled to get one. Before buying this one, I looked up various reviews and this seemed to be a highly ranked/reviewed dishwasher.

Everything was great until we connected the hot water to the dishwasher in the back of the unit. The hot water line connects to a elbow adaptor and the adaptor connects to a plastic inlet hose in the back. Since the hose is plastic, the thread is very easily worn down and connecting the elbow to the plastic thread proved to be very difficult. It's difficult for three reasons: 1) there isn't much clearance in the back for a wrench to tighten the elbow, 2) it's difficult to know if the elbow is connecting to the plastic threads at an angle since the plastic will give a little bit, 3) it's hard to know if the elbow has been tightened enough. I'm not sure why Bosch didn't make this connection out of metal. That would have solved all these issues.

Because of the plastic thread, our dishwasher has been dripping water in the back ever since we installed it over 10 months ago. I've checked the connection about a dozen times. I've completely pulled out the dishwasher and disconnected the hot water and reconnected it about 6 times in the last 10 months (this is a huge hassle). I've added Teflon tape and pipe thread sealant to seal the drip. I've replaced the brass elbow several times. I've removed the plastic inlet valve to inspect it. No matter what I do, there is still a drip in the back. So that the drip does not ruin our wood floor and cabinets, I've secured a clear plastic sheet inside the space where the dishwasher sits. For the moment, this is the only solution I can think of that will keep the drip contained. Once there is enough water pooling below the dishwasher, we are able to see it from the front. I don't want to pay for a new dishwasher or a new inlet valve so this solution will just have to do.",40,"September 29, 2020"

You just adjust the middle rack, no need to start moving everything around. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]",100,"September 23, 2020"
Great and quiet dishwasher!,Love this dishwasher. Ultra quiet! I have to admit that it seems slightly smaller inside than my former kitchenaid so I'm still getting used to best layouts when loading up.  Price was better than most of competition.

Amazingly quiet and incredible at cleaning,"We have had 8 new dishwashers in the past 40 years. I feel like we have tried every brand and feature but I had never seen a Bosch. After a few weeks, I am actually excited to come home from work and empty the dishwasher. Dishes, glasses, cookware and plastics are all sparkling clean and clear. Out flatware has never looked better. I don’t know why I didn’t try Bosch earlier, but I am thrilled to own one now. I’ll probably not get an opportunity to purchase many more in my 
lifetime but I will never consider anything else. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]",100,"September 23, 2020"

Awesome Dishwasher,"This is an awesome machine.  It is so quiet you can stand next to it while it is running and carry on a conversation without any difficulty.

Does not dry & small rack,This dishwasher works good but it does not dry the dishes.  So that is why I can't recommend this dishwasher.

And the racks does not fit my dishes well they are small and made differently from other brands and they do not hold dishes well at all.

Upgrade to This Dishwasher,"After suffering for years with a (non-Bosch) dishwasher that leaked and was so loud that we couldn't run it at night because it kept us awake, this has been a dream. It is so quiet that, when we first got it, we didn't think it was running and kept stopping it to open the door and check. It has cleaned our dishes perfectly, and the top rack for cutlery and utensils makes so much sense. Sort of kicking ourselves for not getting this years ago!

So tight it doesn't dry,This does a great job cleaning. It is very quiet. It has lots of options (3 layers) and it was unique to install but not difficult. Even with the extra dry button I have lots of moisture inside since it is so tight.  The only other thing is it has a child lock but nothing in manual how to program it.

"Took a while to break in, but great dishwasher","This dishwasher was easy enough to install, it's pretty to look at and complements the rest of my kitchen, and it's nearly silent when running.  The indicator light to add JetDry is helpful.  It did arrive with a strong mildew smell in the unit that gave way to a chemical smell for a couple of weeks, and it took probably a dozen wash cycles to remove the odor entirely.  Overall though, it's an efficient, quiet, gorgeous appliance that I expect will serve me well for many years.  

I suspect most people know by now that Bosch dishwashers don't dry the dishes, but it bears repeating:  if the expectation is that the dishwasher dries with a heating element, this is not the machine for you. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]",80,"September 12, 2020"
Quiet roomy dishwasher,My new Bosch dishwasher replaced a 2004 Maytag.  It is much quieter and has more room than my previous one.

Was pleasantly surprised by how quiet the unit really was, but more importantly how clean the dishs and glasses were, even using the basic ""normal"" cycle setting.  Equally, everything comes out dry and spotless on the normal cycle setting, without having to use any of the fancy drying settings/options available.

Yes, although we have not tried anything tough on it yet - only 1 month old so far.   Does it dry?  No, not at all, even with the ""Extra Dry"" option selected.    Does it take a long time - yes, typically 2:25 for a normal cycle, but if you normally run it after dinner its not a big deal.  A minor complaint - The front door has a really stiff spring, so if you close it, it closes pretty tight which I don't like since its always dripping wet inside.  I have to wedge something in the door to keep it partially open so it will dry out.  Another complaint - the thing takes up the entire space under the counter top with very little wiggle room for hoses, power cords, etc to run behind it and it comes with a pretty short power cord, so you might be tempted to wall mount an outlet box behind it but the dishwasher won't fit if you do.  The supposed solution to this is to buy a custom junction box/cord made for the custom power connector on the unit but its short too, so trying to run the junction box just into the cabinet next to the dishwasher is almost impossible.    All in all - its not a terrible dishwasher, but it could be a lot better, and the installation could be much easier with another foot of power cord.",60,"September 8, 2020"

Very Good Dishwasher,"(The email link for the review sent me to this unit.  I purchased the 800 series dishwasher, and this review is for that one).

I have had this dishwasher for a couple of months now.  At first, I wasn't impressed for the cost of this dishwasher.  That is, until I read the manual and followed the recommended settings. Some of the things that I had to adjust to make this a really good dishwasher are:

1. The drying feature of this dishwasher is poor.  This is because it doesn't have the typical heating element in the bottom that steams off the water, (and can melt plastic-ware in the bottom rack).  The manual suggests using rinse-aid, which I have never used before in my previous dishwahsers.  There is also a feature that pop-opens the door at the end of the wash cycle to help the water evaporate.  With both of those used, it dries just as good as my last dishwasher did. 

2. My last dishwasher allowed for all the bottom rungs to fold down.  This model only allowed for a few of them to collapse.  I was concerned about this when I bought it, and almost passed over this model because of that one feature.  I am so glad I didn't.  With the height adjustable top rack, I can fit almost twice as many dishes in this unit than I could with my old one.  I have acutally put in 14 dishes, 7 bowls, and two pans in this dishwasher at the same time.  And no food particles left over.

3. This dishwasher is so quiet.  It really is.  I didn't believe the reviews.  My last dishawasher was so loud that I had to turn up my TV two rooms away when it was running.  You can literally have a conversation right next to this machine without even talking louder.  We have actually said many times that we have to look at the projected light on the floor to know its running.

4. The racks in the store seemed a bit stiff, and the unit was that way for the first couple of weeks.  Now that we've used it for a while, they glide very easily.

The only con I have is that the stainless steel face shows every fingerprint, and isn't ""stainless"".  We accidentally spilled a couple drops of beet juice down the front, and weeks later it's still stained.

Other than the stainless steel, I can't say enough good things about the 800 series dishwasher.  It was definitely worth the money. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]",100,"September 8, 2020"

Buy Something Else,"The Bosch units do not dry the dishes using a heating element, they depend on the heat generated by the water inside making everything hot enough to eventually dry.  This does not work, you better have a dish towel handy when you unload the washer because the plastic racks stay wet so the bottom of everything in the washer will be wet.  Bosch recommends your water temperature to be between 125 and 140 degrees so I set it at 135 and everything is still wet on the bottom.  How is it energy saving when you have to jack up the temperature on the water heater?  And you can forget about anything plastic being dry because they don't hold heat like dishes or silverware.  My wife picked the unit out because Bosch is supposed to be a good name in dishwashers but the 13 year old Maytag we replaced did a much better job overall.  We are highly disappointed with this unit, Home Depot doesn't take returns on appliances and since there are just the 2 of us we'll just do dishes by hand again because you have to dry everything by hand anyway.  Save yourself some grief and money and buy another brand that has an internal heating element to dry your dishes.  Consider us highly dissatisfied customers.",40,"September 4, 2020"

GREAT DISHWASHER,"Although my wife and I have not used all of the features of this product (installed just 3 weeks ago), we can already tell we're going to love it!  It's very quiet; well-engineered; and lives up to the great reviews we read on several sites before purchasing it.  We are very pleased.   Our wine glasses sparkle like never before.  We also like the ability to re-configure the interior to accomodate different amounts of dishes, pots & pans.   The 3rd tray at the top for small items and especially silverware is extremely handy!

Updated Review,"I wrote a review recently stating that the dishwasher seemed to give inconsistent results. Sometimes cleaning very well and then sometimes not very well. Sometimes the detergent pod would be dissolved and sometimes not. Then, it got worse and would not clean even after multiple washings, particularly 
 items on the top racks. Well, after much consternation I decided to pull the dishwasher out and see if I could find the problem. Lo and behold, I discovered a kink in the drain line. Once I got that straightened out, the dishwasher has been working consistently with beautiful results. My guess is since the dishwasher could not fully drain because of the kink, the float or water level mechanism was not sending the signal for more water and the dishwasher would fail to add enough water to engage the top level spray arms. Now, all is well. Such a relief!",100,"August 22, 2020"
Best ever!,My old Bosch dishwasher lasted 15 years so why wouldn't I buy another Bosch? It's even bigger than before and does a beautiful job on the dishes!  It's so quiet!  Good thing it has red lights on the buttons or you wouldn't know it ran!  Sanitizes too!!  Now if it could only make coffee!! [This review was collected as part of a promotion.],100,"August 21, 2020"
Great value,"We're very happy with this dishwasher.   It's so quiet that you literally don't know it's running untill you go right up to it and listen carefully.  If you run it on auto it very reliably washes everything you put in it, and with a litte rinse agent (you can set it to use just a little), things come out clean and dry.  I like having the ability to delay the cycle for up to 24 hours (in one hour increments), and to turn off extra heating to save energy.  The one complaint we have is that it seems harder to arrange larger items in the lower rack, but you get used to it and it's more than compensated for by their unique top rack for silverware and small items - it's a great feature.  The machine feels solid too.  All in all we're happy, especially since the price was modest - not low but not high either. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]",100,"August 21, 2020"
So quiet!,"This handsome unit has beautifully completed my kitchen. It is efficient, QUIET, and easy to use. I adore the ""hidden"" top drawer where I can safely and effectively wash smaller items. I would highly recommend this product. 
My only issue is not with Bosch, but with Finish products. During this Covid crisis, I cannot find Finish dishwasher pods anywhere, but I was fortunate to find the rinse and cleaning product.

I have it on Sanitize cycle which was supposed to be warmer.  I let it sit for 2 hours after the (very quiet!) cycle.  Still wet.  I expected more from this brand.",40,"August 18, 2020"
Fantastic at cleaning!,"We struggled with a near 20 year old dishwasher that cleaned so poorly (even after clearing filters, checking water pressure, and all the maint that could be done), that I had to practically hand wash everything before loading.  With this this new Bosch, I didn't believe the instructions when they said to scrape the food, but don't rinse.  How could it get that much off?!  But it does - it really does! It's become a game - putting in a scraped, but still super-dirty dishes, and see if it comes out clean- haven't been disappointed yet. And with the rinse aid, not only is it clean, it's sparkling.  Totally get the rinse aid.
Nothing in this world is perfect so I will say that the dishes could be dryer when the cycle is done, but if you load dishes carefully to avoid creating puddles, it's really no big deal. I'm also not worried about melting plastic containers on the bottom rack, so it's a decent trade off. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]",80,"August 18, 2020"

Trying to find the best dishwasher ( or any appliance ) nowadays can be challenging. Especially when half the reviews received are through some sort promotion.. if I were to get a product at reduced price/or free I would probably give it great reviews as well...just saying. 
I have had my dishwasher for about a month now...and I absolutely love it. All the concerns I read about in reviews...dishes not drying...smelly inside...all of which were legitimate concerns before I got my dishwasher, all turned out to be non issues. 
My dishes dry perfectly, every time. Will there be water in bowls or cups that have non flat surface where water can pool...obviously... did the dishwasher smell a bit at first..yes..like they stated it may...but it never affected my dishes ...cleaning your dishwasher properly weekly with finish tabs or however you choose to clean dishwasher will also prevent future smells.
My dishes come out perfectly clean, and most times I just use the speed 60 cycle/extra dry. The dishwasher is also so quiet! You do not hear it running at all, which is amazing. 
The arrangement of how to put my dishes in, at first was bit challenging...however once you get the hang of it, you will love it. I love how the second rack is adjustable. The third rack...not totally necessary, I could have it or not have it...but it's there so, I use it. 
All in all this dishwasher exceeded my expectations. When I purchased it, I really was expecting to have issues and was worried I wasted my money. Not the case at all.",100,"August 14, 2020"

Great dishwasher,"The Bosch dishwasher does an excellent job washing dishes.  Amazingly, without a heating element, it manages to get most of the dishes dry.  Plastics remain a problem, but they never dried in my heated Jenn-Air, either.  And at least now I can put plastic items on the bottom rack without worry of melting.  My only complaint is that it does not feel as roomy as my previous dishwasher.  I had to take the 3rd tier silverware rack out in order for the water glasses to go on the 2nd tier and my stoneware plates on the 1st tier.  So I lose the ability to take out the silverware container to allow for bulkier pieces.  The tines are pretty close together, which makes it hard to put in more than one 1/2 gallon container or large popcorn bowl.  And I can't figure out how to lower the tines.  It's not self evident and everything has to be looked up online.  But it is an excellent product. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]",100,"August 4, 2020"

It can still be a little tricky fitting in tall wine glasses, but since they can go on the bottom shelf we are still fitting them in. The only thing I would change is to have the silverware removable basket be segmented into two parts. We often use a few large utensils that need to be set upright in the basket, but don't have enough to fill the basket, so there is some wasted space.

I called the customer service number, and she finally allowed as how it was just to circulate air. Wasn't sure why top rack wouldn't pull out. 
I thought it was maybe a sprayer thing for tall items which should attach to the back -- but that is an Extra not included in my model. The manual, which I downloaded, is extremely unclear about this whole area. Not easy to use.

Very good dishwasher,"I replaced my old one with Bosch 300 series.  I really like it.  This one has the 3rd rack and it is very practical.  You can load a lot of utensils, chopsticks, and save a lot of room for the bottom rack by removing a detachable utensil holder.  The thing I like the most is its quietness.  It is extremely quiet!  The 2nd rack is height adjustable too.  One thing I do not like is that it is hard to load spatulas and ladles because the 3rd rack is too shallow for those and the 3rd rack can also be too shallow (depending on the height of the 2nd rack) and blocking spray arms.  Other than this, this is near perfect dishwasher.  I highly recomment this. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]",100,"July 29, 2020"

"It's quiet, but doesn't dry well","Due to the pandemic, there were not a lot of choices for appliances in our area, so we decided to go with this unit due to the third rack and the availability. It's an okay machine but not my favorite.

Pros:  Dishes are clean, machine is so quiet, its hard to tell if it is running, third rack gets silverware clean and keeps it from nesting, delay feature is convenient

Cons:  Due to lack of a heating element, the interior of unit is almost always wet, plastics do not dry well, split or smaller silverware basket would be more useful since unit has the third rack [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]",80,"July 29, 2020"
Good product,First time buying a Bosch dishwasher the reviews were  good. Had some problems in the begining had to call customer service had a error code . Was not cleaning well for me and leaving the dishes still wet. I decided to call customer support  and was recommended to use Finish Jet-Dry rinse aid for the wettness on the dishes and now also usingh Finish Max in 1 Powerball Detergent working well now because the dishwasher does not have a heating element to dry because the Bosch use Condensing Drying with no heating element. Also brought the extended warranty for the dishwasher. Customer service is good and helpful.,80,"July 29, 2020"
Five star dishwasher,I have only had this washer for about a month it so but so far we love it. It's quiet when running and the dishes come out feeling really clean . It's pretty simple to use. Adjusting the shelves is very easy. I like the extra small top shelve for the silverware . I have had many other brands over the years with not much luck. The reviews for Bosch are very good so I'm hoping this one lasts as long as my first one many years ago which was a Kitchen Aid.,100,"July 28, 2020"

The only thing I can grumble a little about is the fact that the shortest quick cycle is still an hour so when you're in a punch be aware of that.",80,"July 26, 2020"
Reliable Bosch,"Our new Bosch dishwasher is great.  It is solid, works well, and is amazingly quiet.  We have found that the two issues we read about in reviews before buying it are easily addressed as follows:

1 - Smell - It's true that the dishwasher can get a bad odor.  We started by having our appliance company open the dishwasher door a week before they delivered it to us, to dry out the residual water inside the appliance that comes from the factory test wash that is done on each machine before it is shipped out.  Now that we own it, we open the door and let it dry out overnight after running it, and after 2-3 days of sitting without being run.  As long as it is allowed to dry out periodically, it does fine.  

2 - Drying cycle - With a regular wash cycle (we use ""Auto""), the Bosch's unique condensation drying method results in a pretty broad ""okay"" on its own.  Plastics don't dry well, but everything else gets mostly dry.  However, as soon as you add in the Sanitize cycle as well, drying improves a whole lot.  We haven't even tried adding the ""Extra Dry"" cycle; it's doing fine without it.  And since we want to sanitize the dishes anyway, we're happy. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]",100,"July 26, 2020"
Ehh not so great.,"I went by the reviews and am disappointed.  Loads awkwardly, which is OK, but it does not clean as well as my old cheap dishwasher!  This one is expensive and even on the strongest sanitizing setting, I constantly have to hand wash or put something through another cycle.  I thoroughly rinse my dishes and such, so I don't understand.  I clean the filter constantly, just in case and I use Finish and now Lemi Shine (which has helped), but I just don't understand why this machine is getting such high ratings!",40,"July 25, 2020"

"Very quiet, not always completely clean","This dishwasher is so quiet that I find myself grateful for the digital display counting down the time the load has to run, otherwise I might not know it is on at all. Most of the time, the dishes come completely clean. However there are a couple plastic dishes that just don't seem to get properly cleaned. Instead, dirty watermarks are left behind on them. This is not something that happens all the time (we've had the machine for a month and a half and run it daily), but I'm surprised it's happening at all. Otherwise it's a great machine.

300 Series - Pro's and Con's,"Unit is 1"" narrower than a domestically produced dishwasher causing us to have to buy some trim molding to fill a standard gap (replacing a GE Dishwsher). The rubber molding/gasket was not large enough to cover the opening.  Does not dry well, even with Sanitize and  extra dry. Have to empty it and leave the door open for an hour or so in order to dry the inside to avoid developing smell and mold. I now also keep a dry pack of silica gel in it to keep moisture out with the door closed in between uses. Love the adjustable middle rack and top silverware rack, normally don't even need to use the silverware basket.  Cleans the dshes nicely. If it weren't for the light that displays on the floor during use,  I wouldn't know it was even running, very quiet.

SOLID,"Quiet, sturdy, much room especially if you use the top rack for utensils and remove the bottom utensil drawer. Cleans great. Awesome customer service. After a year of use, the face plate showed a tiny crack, where the handle is at the top, due to incredible suction inside the machine and required hand pressure to pull it open. One call to Customer Service, which patiently worked with us to find the correct part and shipped it to us immediately and free of charge.

Best Dishwasher Ever!,Our old dishwasher died on us and we did many reviews to look for a new one. I always heard Bosch was the best. I was skeptical at first until we used it for the first time! This dishwasher is amazing. It cleans the dishes so well and has so much space! It's super versatile and the space that's inside is out of this world. I love the third rack and the middle rack height adjustments. I would recommend Bosch dishwashers to anyone! They are the only brand I would be.

Very happy overall,"This is my second Bosch dishwasher, and overall I am very happy with it. The ""Extra Dry"" feature, which my last model did not have, really does seem to make a difference and avoid excessive hand drying. And I enjoy having the third rack up top for some larger items.

Previously, I also had a Bosch dishwasher, which was the reason why I bought this one. It is one of the quietest dishwashers I've ever had and just love how efficient and well it cleans. One thing I do not like is that there is a pungent smell coming from the dishwasher if I keep dirty dishes in it with door closed, even if it's to wait to start a cycle at the end of a day. It is the nastiest odor even after I tried disinfecting and sanitizing it per instruction manual. A way I have found to steer clear of that odor is just to leave the door open and rack pulled out for the most part until I need to start a cycle.

Just enough features and solid QUIET performance,"We find our new Bosch to be solid - no flimsy parts. Our old Kemore Elite still worked but control panel was gradually losing functions, time to replace. We looked at reviews, talked to neighbors, then dropped by a kitchen store to take a real time look at couple of brands. Immediately understood why Bosch was attractive. Bought from Best Buy during Memorial Day sales event as their low sales price was the same as big boxes plus they threw in free installation!  And their disinstall our Kenmore plus haul it off was something like $29 so great value. Nothing to disconnect in advance!  The install guys were pros and competent and respectful. They did a test rinse cycle and our jaws dropped. We had to strain to hear it, a huge improvement over our trusty old one. Since then, we've found zero issues. We like the extra top tray but find silverware basket more convenient. I use the tray for pizza cutters, spatulas, big spoons, shallow items. Love the capacity, too. No second guessing this buy.

They’ve managed to over complicate the rack design and it’s a constant challenge to load normal dishes. The fancy 3rd rack is a joke. Nothing comes clean up there and there are always a ton of water spots. The middle rack is adjustable BUT again, bad design. You have to press the release tabs AND hold them down while moving the rack. They stay stationary while the rack moves so it’s VERY difficult. I’ve had adjustable racks in the past and every other company has designed them well. The dry cycle doesn’t dry well at all either. There is an “extra dry” option but again when you open the door, everything is still wet.",40,"June 24, 2020"

cleans well,"When my GE Profile DW died I was advised to get a Bosch, which I did. This machine cleans well but is not as versatile in loading as the GE. The tines are not adjustable which would really help on the upper rack. Glasses tend to tip over.  I like the high silverware rack.  The silverware bin that goes on the lower rack is impracticle and I had to remove it.  It takes up a huge section of the lower rack and does not come apart as my bin on the GE did. If this machine didn't clean so well I would be very unhappy. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]",80,"June 23, 2020"

We've been running it for a few weeks and everything has been coming out really clean! I even put a casserole dish in there with a good amount of food stuck on it and it came out clean. My husband said he noticed some dishes come out cloudy but I haven't encountered that problem myself. I love the third rack for small items and silverware! But we did notice that if silverware is really dirty it doesn't clean as well on the third rack and should be put in the silverware basket on the bottom rack. It runs very quietly and overall we are pleased with this purchase!,100,"June 21, 2020"

So much room and versatility to arrange the racks differently. We love the utensil drawer at the top, which allows for removing the utensil rack at the bottom (even more space). It is also incredibly quiet. Giving it 3 stars because we had a problem already with a cheap internal plastic piece coming off repeatedly and making the drawer difficult to slide. The other major complaint is that the main plastic faceplate (where the Bosch name is, where you grab to open the machine) has cracked. The suction is so great within the machine, that the plastic face plate cannot handle the intensity it takes to pull the door open.",60,"June 20, 2020"
Stinky Dishwasher!!,"I purchaed this dishwasher two months ago and while I was pleased with the way it cleaned my dishes, it has a major problem.  It stinks, and I mean that literally.  It smells like a swamp in my kitchen and now my dishes are smelling like fish.  I called Bosch customer service and they agreed to send out their factory service tech.  He examined the machine and labeled it sound.  He said that the door needs to be propped open (It doesn't say that in the owners manual.) Well I can't because then my kitchen would smell like a swamp. He suggested I use a dishwasher cleaner, which I did.  It smelled even worse after running that cleaning cycle. Now all my dishes smell.  It is awful.  They won't back up their product nor offer any working solutions.   I've seen multiple posts on several websites regarding this issue which seems to be a design flaw, but have not found similar unresolvable smell problems related to other brands. So please beware!!!",20,"June 19, 2020"

Fantastic dishwasher and worth every penny,"We bought this dishwasher a couple months ago and it has been nothing but fantastic.

I've put some dishes in with food stuck onto it thinking it would not clean it of but I haven't run into anything it hasn't cleaned so far. The silverware third drawer helps clear out a lot of clutter and the adjustable top shelf helps out a lot for increasing the amount of space you have.

I bought this 300 series based mainly on reviews I found one doing research. At this point I’ve had my new 300 series for about two weeks.

One improvement this new dishwasher has over the old is that the buttons/controls are not on the facing of the dishwasher door. We have a rolling island in our kitchen and I think it may have hit those buttons and broken one or two of them. I had been without  Rinse and hold for several years.

My old Bosch dishwasher was quiet but this one is quieter. I also feel like this new dishwasher has more room than the old though it takes the same amount of space. The third rack on the top which I am new to might not be for everyone as it requires more meticulous placing of silverware than with the basket down below (Which is still an option in this new dishwasher). It Works for me though. I find the time spent placing the silverware in the third rack is made up somewhat during unloading when everything is already nicely sorted.

Home Depot delivery and installation went without a hitch.

truly excellent,"Having moved 14 times with the military and experienced the daily frustrations with cheaply made products, I appreciate decent appliances but this dishwasher is beyond my hopes or expectations.  The machine is well designed and quiet.   After a few days of  overcoming habit and forcing myself to use the cutlery top shelf, I now love how quickly I can unload the utensils and how much more I can get in the bottom basket.

I definitely recommend this machine and am grateful I had friends who recommended it to me. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]",100,"June 6, 2020"
Level Up,"I've had several dishwashers in my lifetime and this is by far the best - and also most expensive. You get what you pay for in my experience. The Bosch is quiet and the interior sleek. Flatware washed in the top level comes out amazingly clean and the flex space in the middle rack makes it very easy to load cups, mugs and Tupperware. The bottom section doesn't seem to line up quite properly for full loading of large plates, but that's the only negative I have encountered.

"Great Dishwasher, Big change over earlier model",We replaced an 10 year old Bosch which was struggling.  The new unit is not quite as quiet as the older unit but is still quiet enough to watch TV in the adjacent room.  Its drain system is much better and we no longer have issues of dirty water not being fully flushed out of the unit.  The new mechanical pushbuttons are much easier to use than the old 'touch panel' that seemed to have a mind of its own.  The only quirk is that when you open the unit you now have to push 'start' button to get the cycle going again.  Until we are fully 'retrained' this results in the dishwasher either not starting its cycle (on delay) or not finishing. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.],80,"May 28, 2020"

When you load wine glasses, they are not sturdy the way that Bosch shows you how to load them.  Already had one glass chip in the washer.  2. There is supposed to be a red light on the floor while it is running, and I have yet to see that light.  I know that is a small problem, but there is no troubleshooting guide online on how to fix that so I guess I get no light.  Overall very nice dishwasher.

Love the 3rd rack,This dishwasher seems to clean well and we especially love the 3rd rack for utensils which allows us to fit many more dishes in the lower two racks and run the dishwasher less.  We also like the rinse-aid sensor that lets us know when the rinse-aid is low. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.],100,"May 27, 2020"
Quiet Dishwasher?,I am not as impressed with my new dishwasher as I had hoped.  I wanted an extremely quiet one which after reviewing what the decibel level was rated at I was very surprised that it isn't as quiet as my old Bosch I had before....

Great machine,"When I bought this machine, there were two major qualities that I was looking for: quality and sound. I wanted a machine that was well made and would do the job well. I know that sounds basic, but in today's world where everything is connected and there are so many bells and whistles attached to expensive appliances, I find it is harder and harder to find. This machine is it. It cleans all my dishes on the first try and feels solid; as well as being backed by the best in the business. It does have some nice features, but as someone who spends most of his time using normal cycles with disinfecting, it had the features I ACTUALLY wanted in a machine that feels like it will last. 

In regard to the sound, the machine is quiet. Not silent, which is fine, but definitely quiet. My dishwasher is in my island which is delineator between the kitchen and the living room where my TV is and I spend most of my show and movie watching time. I can run the cycle and other than the gurgling via my sink once and a while, I barely register that it is running. I even opened it mid-cycle once.

My reaction is don't go super inexpensive. If you can afford it, the machine is definietely worth the money. It looks great, does a great job, and you feel like you are going to get years of service out of it. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]",100,"May 26, 2020"

Love my new dishwasher,"I picked the Bosch dishwasher because it was top rated in a consumer review magazine that I trust, and I haven't been disappointed. It was well packaged and easy to install. I love the separate top silverware tray and the flexible layout in general. It is also very quiet. Can't speak to life cycle yet, but I expect to get long years of service according to reviews.

Perfect dishwasher,"I've heard a lot about Bosch appliances but never bought them before. After going through 3 dishwashers within a couple of years, I decided it's time to give it a try.

Best Dishwasher Ever,"We needed to replace our recalled/builders grade dishwasher and wanted a quiet one. This Bosch filled the ticket!!  It's so quiet, that I have to go check to see if it's running.  It has a stainless steel interior that just shines.  And a bit of a surprise...I didn't know it had a separate top rack just for silverware.  My silverware has NEVER looked so good.  
With its ease of use, quiet running, and stainless interior, I will always stay with the quality of this Bosch. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]",100,"May 23, 2020"
The Best,"I've owned probably every dishwasher on the market: Whirlpool, Kenmore, GE, Maytag...
This is the quietest most efficient one  I've ever owned.  Years of film on my glassware disappeared.  Dried on cheese, salsa and grease are gone.  I've always had to wash my dishes before putting them in the dishwasher. Not anymore.  Don't waste your money on the others.  You deserve the best.

Pretty good dishwasher,"We replaced a 3 year old Whirlpool dishwasher which was fine until the circuit board fried on us.  After replacing that, the pump went out 3 weeks later.  So it was time to switch.
We opted for the Bosch brand base on reputation and reviews.  So far we have been generally pleased with it.  It does a very nice job of cleaning.  We don't use the drying cycle, nor do we use a rinse aid, but it still does well without those.  It helps to crack the door open at the end of the cycle before we head for bed; then things are pretty dry in the morning when we unload it.
I had read one review (after we ordered it) that this Bosch can be smelly.  I think ours has a bit of an odor, but it's not offensive.  It's only two months old, and we haven't run a dishwasher cleaner though it. 
The other thing that has taken some getting used to is the arrangement of the racks.  What worked in the Whirlpool for loading doesn't work well in the Bosch.  After learning to ""work with it"", it's fine.  The third rack on top is very handy and we use it a lot.
All in all, we are well satisfied with our unit.  It's not the top of the line nor the cheapest model, but worth the price. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]",80,"May 22, 2020"

Absolutely love that there are 3 rows. Although the bottom row is configured slightly goofy, but it's not really a big deal. I recommend finding out what kind of electrical hookup you currently have in your house with your current dishwasher before buying this one (or any new dishwasher for that matter). We found out the hard way that didn't have an outlet behind our old dishwasher so my boyfriend had to install one. For someone who knows what their doing, it was no big deal. But if you paid for home depot to install, and then they found out they couldn't hook it up to electrical, you'd be stuck with a dishwasher in the middle of your kitchen until you got an electrician out to your house to configure an outlet. Pain in the butt!! But we've had no other issues with this so far. I'm in love!",100,"May 20, 2020"

Worth the Wait,"Our old dishwasher died at the beginning of the pandemic shut-down.  I checked reviews and ratings and this was the machine I chose.  We had to wait several weeks but the wait was worth it.  I wasn't sure I would use the third rack, but it has become my favorite feature.  No more sorting silver from the basket - presorting for third rack makes it so easy to put the silver into the drawer.  The machine loads easily and holds a lot.  I like being able to load plastics anywhere as there is no heating element on the bottom.  The resulting poor drying is the only drawback.  Using rinse-aid is necessary for optimal drying.  After several weeks, I am quite satisfied with the new dishwasher.  Now I am hoping it will last 15 years like my old one did!",100,"May 17, 2020"
Good Replacement,"I replaced a Maytag dishwasher with this one.  The Bosch 300 Series is so much larger, which I love.  I also really like the silverware on the top shelf, don't have to reach down for them.  I haven't been pre-rinsing and my dishes come out clean.  I use Auto and Sanitize.  The con is the smell.

A part of my 10-year-plan,"I've lived in places with other brands, even grew up with a ""competitor"". In one of the many apartments I rented in my early twenties, was a Bosch dishwasher. For the first time ever I didn't have to pre-soak, or pre-scrub, or pre-wash before using this dishwasher. It may seem silly, but it changed my life. Those few minutes add up over time! I decided, when I purchased my own home, I'd be getting a Bosch. 

Lo and behold, I'm about two and a half years into my first home purchase. The dishwasher that came with the home was okay...it did a decent job at cleaning but left everything wet.  

It was recently my birthday, so I treated myself to my Bosch dishwasher. Things come out SUPER CLEAN the first time and DRY! I absolutely love the display on the outside––no having to guess if the cycle is complete. The manual was easy to understand, it was very helpful to learn to efficiently load this machine.

Latest Bosch dishwasher.,"We had a very good top end Bosch dishwasher.  The handle screws and end caps came loose.  The only way to repair it is to remove the inside panel.  The dealer where we purchased it acknowledged they have never attempted to remove the inside panel over concerns that it could leak.  The dishwasher worked perfectly.  Very very quiet.  Hardly heard it running.  The dishwasher was 12 years old.

We live in a rural area so it is difficult to find a qualified repair person.  So we decided to purchase a new Bosch dishwasher only this one does not have one of the handles.  

The dishwasher does a good job.  Only problem is it is noisy. Very noisy.  I told the same dealer we wanted a quiet dishwasher like the other one.  He said you don't have to worry becUse it is a Bosch.  

Well that's not the case. This dishwasher sounds like a builders grade model you would find in an apartment.  You can hear this thing in our bedroom on the other end of the house from where it is located in the kitchen.  Very disappointed in the sound level of this Bosch Dishwasher.

The lower dish rack is not convenient. It's layout makes it hard to get the dishes in. Other dishwashers are much better there. The silverware basket is bad. I replaced it with one from my previous GE Profile dishwasher which also had a better lower dish rack. However, the Bosch does seem to have more total room.

The third rack is quite good. I don't use it for silverware although I'm sure it would do fine for that. I just find it more useful to hold things like tongs, large stirring spoons, large knives and Tupperware lids.

I also removed the coffee cup racks in the upper rack. We don't use the small coffee cups nor wine glasses so all it did was block out our larger glasses.

My review sounds negative, but I'm actually reasonably pleased with the dishwasher. It does an excellent job of cleaning the dishes and is very quiet.

Love this Dishwasher,"I have owned several dishwashers, but Bosch truly is the best.  No one can match the features, dependability and service offered by this company.  The main reason for my selection is the DB rating or how quiet it is.  No one likes to sit and hear a dishwasher slosh around water and have the pump noise running in the back ground.

There is never a problem with the dishes not getting clean.  

We down sized and bought a new house.  The builder wouldn't install a Bosch without charging a huge amount of money.  So the day we closed we had our local appliance dealer install our Bosh dishwasher.  Sold the builder model for a few bucks.

Value: Fair,"We bought the 800-series to get features and quality. Unfortunately, our unit is plagued with an error-prone display and we also have seen better ""cycle complete"" systems.

Our display frequently has errors we have to reset, and for new users, this process is not straightforward. We're used to it now.

Additionally, the finishing touch is how a dishwasher lets users know that a cycle has been completed. On this unit, no such notification exists. Previous units owned have had a nice, subtle, but easily visible, green light reflecting off the kitchen floor under the unit. If I or my wife run the unit, and the other comes home a few hours later, instead of a notification light, we have to remember to leave a magnet on the front or she may put dirty dishes in on accident.

On a personal note, the unit does have a light underneath during operation, which is somewhat helpful, but it's red, and much as we like red in general, it seems a bit too serious on a dishwasher. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]",60,"May 8, 2020"

Once you figure out best way to load your stuff it can hold a ton and gets everything super clean. Third rack is way more convenient than you would think. Adjustable middle rack is awesome. Not having heating element allows for plastics to be put on bottom rack but somehow stuff is still dry and very hot to touch when cycle ends.Cons - Aside from plates, loading anything else has a learning curve and/or can be awkward. Racks don't quite fit cups well, bowls can be awkward too. But nothing you can't figure out.Summary - Buy this thing. No joke.",100,"May 5, 2020"

Strong silent type,"After 27 years with our Kenmore dishwasher, we were looking for a replacement with the same staying power.  Family members recommended BOSCH so we purchased the BOSCH 300 Series dishwasher.  Strong points: it is extremely quiet, has a top drawer plus large basket for utensils, and has adjustable racks for odd-sized/oversized dishes.  Drawbacks: if you don't choose the Extra Dry option the dishes are wet at the end of the cycle and the selection of this option adds about 20 minutes to an already long cycle (total time nearly 3 hours).

I also love the flat 3rd rack which is a great place for small items that are otherwise vulnerable to falling through and the indicator for adding the rinse aid. 

Things that could be better:   There's no really good place for bowls.  Cereal bowls are limited to side of upper rack. Larger bowls fall forward with nothing to hold them in place.   

The folding tines would be a good if they could be removed and relocated to where they are  needed or were perhaps taller to hold awkward items in place; but the ones on the bottom don't accomplish much

I found their helpful hints on how to load for best washing results very useful. Have a slight issue with the stopping mechanism on the flatware shelf.

Welcome to our kitchen,"We had our previous dishwasher for 23 years and were very happy with it. When it started to leak, we really did not want a replacement, but after some research (incl Consumers Report) we decided on the Bosch 300/ SHEM63W55N. We have not regretted the purchase. In fact I (the female part of the buyers)fell in love with this dishwaher and its features, i.e. capacity, quietness, low energy use. Yes, even at 70 years of age you can find a new love...

Excellent dishwasher,"When it was time to replace our 12 year old, builder grade dishwasher, we looked at many dishwashers.  But in the end we chose a Bosch.  We love the 3rd shelf and the adjustable 2nd shelf.  We like the fact that some of the racks can fold down to make room for larger items. And this dishwasher seems to hold more items than our last one.  Most of all, we love how quiet it is.  We can turn it on and watch TV at the same time in the great room and not hear the  dishwasher.  (The kitchen and great room are one big room). Before we had to run the dishwasher late at night when we were in bed and we could still hear it.  We like it so much that we recommended it to my husband's cousin and they went out and bought the same dishwasher recently. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]",100,"April 14, 2020"

Elegant and Efficient,"I used to think that dishwashers were all about the same but I have changed my mind since buying this Bosch dishwasher. I'm very impressed with the functionality of having three racks and that the middle rack can be moved up or down, to give a few inches either way. It may be a small addition but the flatware/utensil rack is my favorite feature. It makes unloading the flatware so easy. My dishes come out dry and spotless. Two other features that make this dishwasher excellent are the 24/7 sensor that prevents leaks and the easy to remove self-cleaning filter.

Everything we were hoping,"We were in need of a new dishwasher as out old one was just so noisy that there was no question when it was running.  
As we solicitated opinons from friends and a few repair men the Bosh kept comming up.
We have not been disappionted!  The only challenge that we had was finding the best place and orientation for our cereal bowls.  The don't quite rest securely on the top shelf so to the bottom they must go.
Every item that we have washed has come out clean.  We have been using Cascade pods and jet dry with great results.
The noise difference is phenomenal, this dishwasher is so quite that I have looked for the lights just to make sure it is running.

We are still working to determine the best ways for loading.

A well-designed dishwasher,"I have probably owned 10 dishwashers in my lifetime and this one is by far the closest to perfection.  It is so well designed; it uses every nook and cranny.

Fantastic Washer,"I am really enjoying my Bosch 300 series dish washer. When I went shopping for a new washer after my 30 year old washer kicked the bucket, I was overwhelmed by all the choices. This Bosch washer came to my attention through the recommendation by Wirecutter.

It is very quiet, loads well, and has the third upper shelf that I use for utensils. This means I don’t have to use the basket in the bottom rack and so much space is filled up. It was definitely worth the extra money to get the model with the third rack. 

The only drawback is that it doesn’t dry plastic very well. I knew this going in because it was pointed out in The Wirecutter review, and I’m okay with that. The other benefits outweigh some slightly still wet plastic containers. 

Also, it was simple to install and looks great. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]",100,"April 10, 2020"

Good Value,"This dishwasher is quiet. We are still learning the various features and optimal loading configurations. The drying cycle is still learning in progress. The cycles take a longer time than our older unit; however, the dishes come out much cleaner, without any film. Still up for debate is where to put silverware-the thin, third shelf or the rack on the botton shelf. YouTube offers a variety of videos with tips and opinions on such topics, which are very informative and helpful. twWe are very satisfied overall.

Amazing dishwasher,"This is my second Bosch dishwasher.  Buying the second was a no brainer for me.  The quality and style are far superior than other brands friends and family have.
The new features on my new dishwasher are fantastic. (60 min and extra-dry)
Also, I didn't think possible, it got even more quiet.  On several occasions, not looking at the lights on front, I opened the door to place another dish inside, but to my surprise, it was in mid-cycle.
I highly recommend this dishwasher and give 15 stars out of 10!

Very industrial,"This unit does exactly what it is supposed to,  with little fanfare, but still a good unit. Con: very long wash time on auto function (over 2 hours), some smell as noted by others online (but no odor or taste on the dishes), not smudge resistant at all and a loud clacking sound when it locks and unlocks.  Pro: very flexible shelving, super quiet (even compared to a not-so-old) previous model and cleans everything with no excuses. I would recommend it if you are like me and are most interested in tools doing what they are meant to do. I would avoid it if you want the newest, prettiest thing.",80,"April 9, 2020"

Bosch is one of the best Dish Washers on the market and I have installed many. The only draw back that needs to be known is that it is not an installation for newbies... even if you have done one in the past. The 300 Bosch has to be plumbed and powered differently than any other dishwasher.. The water supply line and drain requires some careful planning and would recommend professional installation. Other than the install it has been a great machine. It very quiet and has enough racks to accommodate a number of different tastes in loading.,100,"April 7, 2020"

Good dishwasher,So we've had our dishwasher for over a month now and have done at least two dozen loads through it. It's pretty quiet and I like the third rack for flatware and other small items.

"Looks good, quiet, cleans dishes, easy to maintain","I had a Hotpoint basic dishwasher (DW) for almost 30 years when the springs for the door broke. I decided to purchase a new one. Two items sold me on the Bosch 300 DW: the physical buttons on the face of the dishwasher, and the ease in which the filter came out and could be replaced after cleaning. I literally removed and replaced all the filters on the dishwashers I was considering. The Bosch dishwashers were simple to remove and replace. No other DW considered even came close. Regarding use: my dishes are clean and mostly dry except for some puddling on top of some mugs.  I did bounce up the setting for the drying liquid and dishes are as dry as possible. The dishwasher is very quiet particularly compared to my old one. Installation did take both a plumber and an electrician since my old DW was wired in, not plugged in, and a new electrical outlet had to be installed. I am enjoying using this new appliance!

"Good wash, difficult loading","Rarely any need to rewash anything, but the layout of the shelves makes loading challenging. The extra tray at the top reduces the height of the upper shelf so plastic kids plates and taller glasses can be tough to get it and that isn't helped by the extra fold down tray on the right side of the upper rack that makes it harder to get glasses in on the right side - surely this tray is no longer needed???

Good product,"I like the dishwasher.  It cleans well and dries everything, even plastics much better than my old dishwasher did.  It is quiet which is good.  It does take much longer to run than my old dishwasher, but I guess that is normal for dishwashers these days.  Should be saving me a lot of water by the stats.  The one thing I don't like is the 3rd shelf.  I thought I would love it, but I have to give up something.  If I have the middle shelf set to a higher level in the dishwasher in order to fit plates and cutting boards on the bottom without the sprayer arm running into them, then I cannot fit wine glasses in that middle shelf (they hit the top shelf).  If I put the middle shelf down lower to fit those wine glasses, then the plates and cutting boards hit the sprayer arms.  I think my plates and cutting boards are a pretty normal size-not overly big.  So I have given up putting wine glasses in and washing them by hand unfortunately.

Dishwasher Bosch,"This dishwasher is so awesome..it has actual lighted buttons that you can push.

"I thought I would love the 3 racks, but am...","I thought I would love the 3 racks, but am finding that I would rather have 2 racks.  With the configuration of the 2 bottoms racks, I have to sacrifice something.  If I raise the middle rack in order to fit plates and cutting boards, then it is too high and wine glasses hit the top rack.  Lower the middle rack so wine glasses fit, and plates hit the sprayer arm so it can't go around properly.  I feel like I have normal sized plates, so this might be a problem for others as well.  Other than that, it cleans well, is quiet and seems like a good dishwasher.  I have to get used to the longer wash time-over 2 hours!  One thing I do really like about it is that it dries everything well, even plastics.",80,"March 31, 2020"

lack of drying of dishes and tub remaining wet,"We had purchased a Bosh dishwasher 5 years ago in another house and loved it. When the dishwasher in current house failed we did not hesitate to buy a Bosh although it was more expensive. The first time we used the new dishwasher, the dishes and inside of the tub were very wet. We then tried using Extra Dry. The dishes and tub were better but still very wet. We read through the documentation and set the default to extra dry. We ran a load of dishes before being gone for the weekend. When returning, we found that the dishes and tub were still WET! We did some research and found that this was a common complaint of this dishwasher. We returned the Bosh and bought an LG. The LG is working well.

Error codes left and RJ,"Purchased this about two years ago.  A few months after installation error code 24 appeared and has not stopped.

Called back to schedule a service call and I am now being told we are out of warranty.  In addition this may now be a circuit panel issue and a  $250 expense.

Is it even running?!,"I was so excited to replace my 15 year old dishwasher with this Bosch and let me tell you, it is a GAME CHANGER.  First of all, my old dishwasher sounded like a jet engine in my kitchen.  Our family got used to working around this noise pollution, but when we got our new dishwasher and they turned it on for the first time you can't even hear it!!  It's so quiet, I have to put my hand on it to make sure it's on.
The other big feature I really like, is the completely stainless steel tub.  The trap in my old dishwasher was GROSS and discolored plastic garbage, but with the stainless steel, I can pull it out and sanitize it to my liking.
This is an awesome dishwasher.  I would 100% recommend to anyone looking for a new dishwasher. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]",100,"March 25, 2020"
Cleans well!,"So far haven't had any trouble with it. It cleans well, and is easy to use.

New Bosh Dishwasher,"We love our new Bosh 300 Series Dishwasher.

I installed it myself (I am an avid DYI guy). The instalation was easy eventhough I had some little odd features that I had put into the original dishwasher instalation at the end of a counter that goes out into the kitchen. The counter is a combination of stock and custom make cabintry and required some creative wiring and plumbing. The Bosh instalation proceedure was clear and easy to adapt.

The new Bosh is 100% quieter then our previous brand. The first few time we used my wife and I were asking each other if we had turned on the dishwasher?

I think the Bosh easily removable/cleanable skreen in the wash tank is wonderful. Our last brand had a little screen and chopper that was a major project to get to and got clogged quite a bit.

The Bosh will be easy to clean out any odd debris.

The Bosh is also cleaning our dishes to a brite spakeling shine.

Quietly Great Dishwasher,"This dishwasher cleans dishes quietly, efficiently & without fuss. You really don't hear it running at all on auto setting. You have to remember that this model does not have the heat coil at the bottom, so you'll need to ensure you have jeydry in it along with allowing the dishes to dry inside the washer. At least the inside is stainless steel to help with the heat drying. Having the second sprayer on the glasses level helps with the cleaning as well.

What a dishwasherwas meant to be,"Up until 3 years ago I did not live in a house with a dishwasher.  We moved into a new house with a builder grade dishwasher and I thought it was doing a good job.  Then it had to be replaced and we bought a Bosch.  When they say it is quiet, it is quiet.  Living in an open floor plan the dishwahser is about 14 feet from the tv.  It can't be heard when we are watching tv.  I can put casserole dishes in that have baked on food and they come out clean.  So glad we bought this instead of the other dishwashers we were looking at.

Totally Satisfied,"I did research on dishwashers first to see which were better for hard water and found Bosch was one of the top recommended.   I then went to my local appliance store and told them I was looking for a Bosch dishwasher due to the fact I have hard water and this was a top contender.  they showed me what they had and I was very impressed with it and the fact that it had moveable racks and an extra shelf.   Needless to say, I bought it and have been very highly satisfied with the job it has done and also the quietness of the product.   I would highly recommend this dishwasher.

We worried, ""wait it's not working this time,"" again we opened it to find the water running and everything working perfectly. Its SO quiet!

my love affair with my dishwasher,"this is my third Bosch Dishwasher.  As with all of them, it is quiet and does a thorough job.  The third shelf handles spatulas, pizza cutters and knives.  There is ample room for dishes/flatware from  a dinner party of 6-8 .  There is room for large bowls and some platters.  It has completely cleaned plates and forks with dried on eggs.  It has completely cleaned the dried on bread dough from mixer bowls and kneading hooks.  This won't be my last Bosch unless it out lives me.

Wonderful Upgrade. Very Quiet. Great Cleaning.,"I have been very impressed with my recently purchased Bosch 300 Series Dishwasher. Installation was very easy and the instructions were very clear. This dishwasher is very quiet! I can barely hear it from a distance of 10-12 feet. It does a great job of cleaning too, as evidenced by tests with some tough, baked-on dishes. The display and functionality is very nice. I especially like the ""Sanitize"" and ""Extra Dry"" functions. Use the Bosch ""Stainless Steel Conditioner"" and a micro-fiber closth to keep the stainless steel finish pristine! [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]",100,"March 17, 2020"
Great dishwasher,"This machine seems to have a very solid build quality. It is extremely quit and does a great job washing dish's. It has different washing option's, but the 60 minute cycle, the one you would use for lightly soiled dishes seems to do the job with all but the very heavily soiled, with backed on dry food. It does have a feature that will boost the water temp, and water pressure to clean the most stubborn dishes you may have, but I can't imagine ever needing to use that. It does that good of a job. The third rack on top for utensils is very useful, and free's up space on the bottom rack by not having to use the utensil insert for that, but of course you can if you wasnt. The inside is very spacious, and has a lot of options for configuring it to accomodate various sizes and shapes of pots, containers, and other dishes. I thought this model was supposed to have a light that shines  on the floor to let you know that yes, is on and running, but doesn't seem to. But that is in no way an issue, totally uneccessary actually. All in all, very happy with this product, I hope it lasts. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]",100,"March 17, 2020"
Great dishwasher!,"Best dishwasher I've ever owned! I can't believe how quiet it is and I love the 3rd rack and the adjustable  middle rack. Amazed at how well it cleans even dirty dishes - no more washing dishes before I wash the dishes! I enjoy having the cycle options and delay start.

The build quality is the key.,"Over the past few years, we have slowly been replacing our aging appliances on an as-needed basis. It began a decade ago with our washer and dryer and that's when we started looking at Bosch appliances. Our experience with even the base-line Bosch products is that the build quality is excellent. When you focus on the basics and do it well, everything else falls into place - and that is exactly what Bosch has done. 

We chose this specific model of dishwasher because it did not have the typical membrane-style control panel. Call me old-fashioned but, physical switches appealed to me. The Maytag dishwasher we replaced suffered many issues over the years, having to replace the control board and control panel a couple times. When the problem arose again, we decided to cut our losses and again look at the Bosch appliances, due mostly to our experience with the washer/dryer set we purchased 10+ years ago. I have to say, to get into the ballpark build quality of the base-line Bosch, you have to buy mid-line or better of the typical brands. And even then, they're not quite up to the level of this Bosch. This isn't hyperbole, it's fact. I encourage you to truly comparison shop.

Installation was a snap, it was a push-in replacement. And holy cow - the sound level of this thing is incredibly quiet. That first run, I had to open it to make sure it was in-fact operating. That is no exaggeration. The quality of the cleaning is excellent. Coming from the old Maytag, where we had to pre-rinse everything, now having the ability to just toss in the dirty place settings and go is nice. The only detraction of points I would give is that the drying is not quite as good as it could be. But I think this is probably more to do with Energy Star ratings, as almost all other brands seem to have similar issues noted in ratings. And honestly, it's not a BIG deal. And certainly not unlike others on the market. Energy ratings are going to drive this issue regardless of brand.

The bottom line is I whole-heartedly recommend this Bosch dishwasher. It performs very well, is insanely quiet, and was a snap to install. I've been using it daily for a month and couldn't be happier with the decision. And if my experience holds, as with the Bosch washer and dryer purchase I made over a decade ago, I expect this dishwasher to be a true workhorse in the kitchen: strong and reliable. You cannot ask for more than that. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]",100,"March 15, 2020"
Great Dishwasher,This is a super roomy and super quiet dishwasher! Runs GREAT! The only problem we have with it is that it is so well sealed that there is an odor in it after the dirty dishes sit in it for a day.

Very disappointed!,"So disappointed in this supposed “quality” dishwasher!!! If you cook AT ALL or have kids....DO NOT BUY!!! Seriously, a 9x13 pan DOES NOT even fit correctly . You have to lie it flat which takes up most the space. If you make lasagna with other pans and plates look for a different dishwasher!! I called BOSCH customer service and she said she and her husband had the same issue with the same pan over the weekend. I also called the store where I bought It. Apparently it only works if you take out the utensil tray. Say what? I did so and per instructions used the upper rack for utensils. They came out DIRTY and the pan STILL had to lie down anyway. VERY POOR design. Then there is the top drawer that you have to slam shut to get it to wedge into position so the door closes and locks. The glasses cling and fall over. The customer service agent agreed that this is a flaw but tried to change my term of “slam” into what they call “firm push”.... Bosch, are you serious?? Obviously an engineer who doesn’t cook or have kids designed the stupid thing. The buttons are super cheap, wire drawer slots WAY to close together, some at an extreme slant for not great purpose ....customer service agreed they get lots of calls on this. I run my dishwasher twice a day. Huge buyer remorse and never again Bosch!!!",20,"March 11, 2020"

"Well-made, Simple, Quiet","The title of this review almost says it all.  The Bosch 300 is simple in the sense that the controls are straight-forward and easy to understand. I had read some reviews in the past that cticize the racks.  We, however, find that we can put more dishes in a load, in a more orderly manner, than we could with our orl dishwasher.  The only quibble I have is that the installation, specifically the power supply hook up, is more complex than many.  But you only have to do that once.

quiet - my refrigerator is lounder than my Bosch dishwasher!

the third shelf - love having a place that larger utensils can go and not fall through the shelf

Not the best:
I am unable to place glasses on the bottom rack.  They tip into each other and into other things.  I'm afraid they will break if they rest on each other during a wash cycle.  I like to have them on the bottom rack because the middle one tends to fill up quickly.

I have a set of 4.5"" bowls that really don't have a place to stand like larger bowls can.  They end up taking up a lot of space. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]",80,"February 4, 2020"

Great so far but......,"Solid dishwasher from Bosch. I have never owned a Bosch product but the reviews led me to pick this brand and model. All reviews were good from several different sources. My dishwashers have always been the cheaper models so I didn't realize how loud they were or maybe another way to view it, how quite this dishwasher runs. Racks are better made (my last dishwasher racks were held together with zip ties). So, I rate it great so far but I have only had it for a month and a half. I don't like giving high ratings on things that I haven't had long. That's the reason for a four star. In a year, I would hope to give it 5 stars. Durability is my number one concern of any product I buy. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]",80,"February 3, 2020"
Replacement dishwasher,"We like the dishwasher and are hoping it lasts longer than the last one, 4 years.  It cleans dishes well and switches are set back so that I'm not constantly bumping them on.  I have noticed that the door stays shut rather tight and this causes odors to stay inside the cavity of the dishwasher.  I would change that if I could.  Racking is different but i was able to adust to that and make things stack reasonably well.  Also the rince dry container leaks after you fill it and tilt the door upright.  It is hard to tell if the liquad is staying in there at all so I'm guessing I will go through a lot of it. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]",80,"February 3, 2020"

First Dishwasher is a Winner,"In our 48 years of marriage, we've never owned a dishwasher. We recently renovated our kitchen and added a dishwasher. I checked with my niece who is an interior designer who suggested Bosch and Wirecutter which recommended this model. Good advice from both.

We've had it 6 weeks now and are very satisfied with our purchase. The dishwasher is quiet and cleans very well. The interior design is very flexible with a variety of ways to configure it, giving a lot of options in loading it. It easily accepts half-sheet pans and a 6-qt soup pot.

Great dishwasher,"This is a great dishwasher. While we are still getting used to the top utensil rack, we are really happy with our purchase.

Everything we could hope for in a dishwasher,We replaced our 8 year old GE dishwasher that was no longer drying our dishes and had a horrible mildew smell. We chose a Bosch dishwasher due to the company's reputation and have not been disappointed. Our dishes always come out clean and dry. The controls are intuitive and there is minimal maintenance required (occasionally filling up the rinse aid and cleaning out the filter every 3-4 months). The dishwasher itself appears very sleek and clean and fits well in our kitchen decor. We love the 3rd dishwasher rack for utensils--the utensils are always thoroughly clean. We are very satisfied with our purchase and will strongly consider purchasing additional Bosch appliances in the future. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.],100,"January 30, 2020"

In my old dishwasher, I used to be able to put 15 place-settings of plates, stemware, and cutlery from our family Sunday lunches. That won't fit easily now.

I never knew what I was missing!,"I read the reviews. I did my homework. I researched like crazy to get a new dishwasher that does more than just act as a dish holder/dryer. My old dishwasher never cleaned. No matter what I did, the dishes were spotty and even lightly attached food was not removed! 

But this...THIS Bosch! WOW! Not only does it clean like a boss, but it's SO quiet, I had to stand near it and put my head on the door to make sure it was running! Quiet! SO QUIET!

The interior has a nice, thin top rack for larger kitchen utensils, an adjustable middle rack that raises up high enough to still hold cups and allow for large plates on the bottom. 

The utensil basket is great. It lifts up if you don't want to put your utensils in the little boxes (but I prefer to). It also easily lifes out and clips onto the bottom rack. So convenient. 

The drying on this unit is great too! Whether I airdry by opening the door after it's done, or letting the heater do its job, the dishes are spotless. 

Even the door itself is solid, closes quietly, and feel solid and well-built. 

Lastly, the controls are super easy to use, easy to see, and I really like the on/off button (which my old dishwasher did not have).

It is also great for small plastic lids...you know, the ones that get lost among the larger dishes or takes up too much space in the silverware basket.

"quiet unit, odd racks","It's a nice dishwasher, but the racks within it do not lend themselves to loading.  A lot of space inside gets wasted, water flow gets obstructed, glasses get knocked over, since we're trying to fit dishes and such around all the wierdly angled pegs in the rack.  If I could swap the racks out for one with straight pins, I would.

It's a quiet unit, clearly powerful, and the fast 60 minute cycle is a nice feature.  I like how the food filters inside come out easily and go back in, just as easily.  The third tray on the top was a surprise.  One of these days we'll figure out how our silverware fits in it, but the plastic tray is good for sharp knives and cooking utensils.

Unsurprisingly Great,"The GE dishwasher that came with our new house died a few months ago. After extensive research we decided to purchase a Bosch dishwasher. What an incredible upgrade! Dishes are clearner with no water spots. We used to have to turn up our TV when the dishwasher was running... no more... the Bosch is so quiete we have to look at the LED display to confirm that it's running. The third upper rack has become indispensible... I do a lot of home baking so there are always instruments like spatulas, whiskers, etc that are sometimes difficult to fit... no longer. Even though the interior size is no larger than our old machine the layout is much better designed and has built-in flexibility such as fold down plate holder and abilty to adjust the height of the 2nd shelf. We can fit a lot more in the machine without compromising quality of the wash. We have not had the machine long enough to credibly comment on durability but we have had a Bosch washing machine for 12 years and it's still going strong... we're anticipating that the same will be true of our new dishwasher. I wish all my purchases turned out this well. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]",100,"January 29, 2020"

Best Dishwasher for the price,"This is our second Bosch dishwasher and the best we’ve ever owned.  It was fairly priced, has three drawers (the top one for certain bigger utensils) and a drawer you can raise and lower to accommodate taller items on the lower drawer.  The utensil basket on the lower drawer is longer and accommodates more.  This dishwasher is very quiet and efficient.  I love having the controls on the front panel.  I will remain a loyal Bosch customer as long as they continue to produce quality products for a fair price. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]",100,"January 29, 2020"

Best Dishwasher,This is the best dishwasher I've owned! It cleans the dishes & pots & pans impressively. I use to think of dishwashers as an extra step. I had to wash them before putting them in the dishwasher. This one cleans the dishes with only a scraping off & can be left more than a day before starting it.

Sparks Joy,I've never had a kitchen appliance make me happy like this dishwasher does. I had to pack dishes into my old dishwasher like a game of Tetris. This unit seems cavernous in comparison. When my old dishwasher was running it sounded like there were two cats inside having a fight to the death. With this dishwasher all I hear is an occasional swoosh of water and some gurgling. It loves cleaning my dishes and I love giving it dirty dishes to clean. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.],100,"January 29, 2020"
Great so far. Rack set up a little awkward,The dishwasher runs great. Cleans well and is quiet. The only drawback is that the bottom rack is oddly set up at least for our dishes and bowls.

Delivers everything it promises,"This dishwasher is amazing. Firstly, it thoroughly cleans the dishes in a way no other dishwasher I have owned does. Secondly, it's so quiet that my husband has thought I forgot to run it, only to walk into the kitchen and discover it was already halfway through a cycle. We love the top accessory drawer; even though the little slots are meant to hold cutlery, we find that it's perfect for holding those little medicine cups, along with lids, large utensils, chopsticks, and other misc. items. The middle drawer is adjustible, which allows you to put much taller items in if you need to. All in all I would definitely recommend this dishwasher to anyone. We have been satisfied beyond our expectations! [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]",100,"January 29, 2020"

The installers would not touch the installation because we have a 3"" section of ¾"" copper pipe between our kitchen disposal and the discharge hose. They installers insisted that they could not install anything with copper because HD holds them responsible for any problems associated with copper. So here are my comments on the installation. The Bosch installation manual could be better. It has step by step instructions, but very few tips on how to do some of the steps. I had a lot of trouble leveling the unit because of the soft plastic leveling feet that were very difficult to turn initially. I could turn them with a large slotted screwdriver, but found a small adjustable wrench more satisfying later on. They could have told us to use a 10 mm socket to adjust the height of the rear height adjuster. The real kicker was the detail at the end of the manual that required the drain hose to be at least 33"" off the floor at some point! That's pretty tough when the cabinet height is 36"" and there is a sink in the way. I used some scrap wood and made a plate to which I secured the plastic hose support that Bosch suggested. I maneuvered plate up as high I as could get it and fastened it to the way with several drywall screws. This was pretty tough because my arms are not long enough and my electric drill is quite heavy by today's standards. We have run a test load to make sure I hadn't messed anything up.
I can testify that this dishwasher is incredibly quiet. Its regular cycle is on the long side. I will revisit this review when we accumulate more time with it.",100,"January 16, 2020"

You will also need to purchase a brass elbow with a faucet connection on one end to connect water to the dishwasher as this isn't provided.  The other end to mate with whatever water hose you have.  It installed nicely.
   The front controls will default to the Auto mode and can't be changed if the drying agent compartment isn't filled with something (we use water as we don't want to use a drying agent).  Other than figuring that out, the controls are easy to use and seem to be very robust.  We've used it now for about 3 weeks and it does a fantastic job washing the dishes.

Quiet as our last Bosch Dishwasher,"This is our second Bosch Dishwasher and it is as quiet as the last one. These dishwashers are not just quiet but noticably quieter than most dishwashers. The standard washing cycle does an excellent job also. On the downside, it takes much longer to do the same wash job and unless we add extra time for additional drying, the dishes come out damper than in the old dishwasher. In looking into this I understand this is caused by new standards which, while using less water and enegry, also take longer and dont dry as well.

I scrape the dishes before I put them in but don't feel that I should have to rinse them off before washing them in this dishwasher.  My previous dishwasher was a Kenmore which was about 15 years old and did a better job cleaning and drying and I almost never used the extra dry cycle.  If you use powdered soap in the Bosch, some of it will cake up hard and not all be used up.  You have to hit it hard to get it out of the soap tray afterwards.

Bosch rep stated that my dishes are too heavy ( Not sure who buys a dishwasher with a maximum weight capacity in mind nor do appliance stores sell them with weight capacity). Put in fewer dishes still collapses &caused dent on the door inside. Bosch stated that I exceeded the maximum weight ( which is not indicated in manual nor could Bosch tell me the maximum weight and that my stoneware is too heavy(manual states nothing about dinnerware stoneware may be too heavy).
Bosch sent a new lower rack same happened. I now have a dishwasher that can only handle 3 plates at a time on lower rack.
The only 1 good thing about it ... it's so quiet I have no idea that the lower rack collapses during a cycle. I only give it 1 star is because I have to or I cannot submit the review [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]",20,"December 22, 2019"

Bosch 300 series,So far very pleased with how quiet it sounds and how well it cleans. I am struggling with how to load dishes most effectively on lower level.

Great Dishwasher,"Pros:  quiet, good selection of options, very effective cleaning.

Not Perfect:  I can't find a good way to tilt cups so water is not pooling on the inverted bottom of cups.

Tip:  if there's room inside the space for the dishwasher, consider adding sheetrock to cabinet sides for extra sound deadening.  Seemed to work, but unit is very quiet regardless. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]",80,"December 17, 2019"
Dishwashet,"Overall I like my dishwasher. The only things I don't care for are the dishes don't completely dry. Even when i set it on extra dry. Also I don't like that if im running a wash cycle and open the door to put something else in, you have to remember to push the start button again. It does not automatically restart the cycle. I do like that the dishes get very clean and my silverware has never gotten cleaner. Overall I would recommend thos product.

I purchased this dishwasher after I moved and left behind my older model Bosch dishwasher. I love the quietness of this dishwasher and the top 3rd rack is awesome. The adjustable racks are genius! The only downfall on this one is that it doesn't dry good enough. Even if I use the ""extra dry"" feature, it still leaves a lot of water behind on the dishes to where I have to towel dry all of my cups and plates. My older model did an amazing job drying the dishes. But, it is not enough for me to go through all the hassle of returning it to the store.

Plastic tops, if placed flat in the shallow top 3rd rack, do not get completely dry, and will still have some standing water in them at the end of the cycle, even with the higher dry time option selected.  Flat utensils placed in the top 3rd rack do get dry.   The red cycle indicator lamp which shines on the floor at the right corner of the dishwasher is a nice touch.  It comes with a cord, drain hose and water inlet hose.   The optional electrical connection junction box (purchased separately) is a good quality box which makes for an easy connection with screw terminals, rather than wire nuts, which are normally used with a standard junction box.",100,"December 10, 2019"

This unit replaced our 18 year old Bosch which was much noisier and did not offer multiple wash cycles. The additional upper third tray is handy for washing flat items. Dishes come out squeaky clean.

"Neat, clean, efficient","This machine was professionally installed for me.  It looks neat and clean and is easy to keep clean.  The silverware tray, a flat tray at the top, is an excellent feature, permitting numerous pieces to be inserted sideways and they are much easier to remove and sort than from the traditional baskets (also no accidental cuts from knives!). Two levels are for the usual things one washes, with racks that fold down or up as needed.  It is very quiet, the only noise that is faintly heard is the sloshing of water and this can be decreased with properly placing dishes, pans, etc.  The use of the extra drying is recommended as is the soap type suggested by Bosch; both make the final product clean and dry.  Very pleased with the machine. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]",100,"December 4, 2019"

It is every bit as wonderful as I expected. It is quiet, of course. In addition, it cleans perfectly, and even plastics are dry when I unload. The space inside leaves plenty of options for filling it up per the needs of each load. And I love the convenience of the silverware rack.

As expected,"From all the reviews we'd read Bosch was at the top of the list. The only question was which model. We bought this particular model because we didn't want a handle and wanted to see the time remaining in the cycle.  The unit is ultra quiet. So much so it's hard to tell it's actually running.  It's like heaven compared to our previous one.  Our has three racks. We like and use the top silverware one all the time. I have only two items that could be improved. The second rack normally for glasses doesn't seem to fit ours very well so we can't pack as much as before. The other is the silverware rack on lowest rack.  We don't use it hardly at all but when removed it's not really good for anything else.  No foldable rack or groves for other dishes.  Regardless, I wouldn't trade those fixes for the quiet and the spotless dishes. It does an incredible job cleaning and we only scrape off the food. It's does the rest.  One more thing I would like to have - a hard food disposal.  Don't like having to clean the filter once a month. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]",100,"November 24, 2019"

Great Dishwasher!,"This is our third Bosch DW (in 3 different houses over about ten years) and the second with the third rack feature.  We still can't believe that it dries the glassware better than the ones with heating elements that we replaced. The racks also allow us to put more plates and bowls in each load. And, of course, the third rack for flatware and utensils is a big part of that. Oh, and they are definitely quiet, which is very important for our open concept home. These machines really do a great job! [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]",100,"November 22, 2019"
DO NOT BUY THIS DISHWASHER UNTIL BOSCH RECTIFIES THE DEFECT BOTTOM RACK. I bought this dishwasher...,DO NOT BUY THIS DISHWASHER UNTIL BOSCH RECTIFIES THE DEFECT BOTTOM RACK. I bought this dishwasher in September 2019 and have only been able to wash dishes on top rack and only plastic on bottom rack. The bottom rack collapses with any weight on it. Bosch has order a new bottom rack but I have still not received it because the racks have not passed quality control according to Bosch. They are now telling me December for the new rack. I was informed by Bosch there is a maximum weight capacity on the bottom rack but it is not printed in the manual nor could they tell what the weigh capacity is....never heard of such a thing neither has anyone else.It gets great reviews but need to research lower rack. This seems to be a common issue that has not been corrected.,20,"November 22, 2019"

Excellent Dishwasher,"First of all, it's amazingly quiet. The upper 3rd rack is super helpful for items other than silverware. And it's very convenient to use. It's easy to load, the racks are sturdy and not cheap and thin like most every other model we looked at. The only issue I can note, is that the LED color for the monitoring of the dishwasher is bright red. Yes, it's easy to read but the red is somewhat jarring. Small issue, but worth knowing about.

How can you love a dishwasher?,"Let me count the ways: when it’s quieter than your whispered kitchen conversations; when it reminds me to add rinse aid; when the controls are simply intuitive; when it has a third rack for flatware; and, unheard of, when it thoroughly cleans and fully dries everything we toss in.

Bosch 300 Series Dishwasher,"Since purchasing our new dishwasher we have that it does a very good job in cleaning the dishes we put in it. The way the dishwasher is layed out permits us to put in many more dishes, pots & pans, etc than we were able to put in our previous dishwasher. It also gives us many more choices in how we wash the dishes. Bosch has a good reputation which is one of the reasons we purchased it. Also the 3rd rack up top is very convient to put utensils and other items that protect them from other items. Overall we arevery pleased with this dishwasher.

Thank goodness they included the standard flatware basket on the lower level (at first I wondered why it was there, but now I know).  I removed the top rack and am much happier with both its cleaning performace and loadability.  It dries well on the Auto setting, but not so much on the Normal setting.  Overall it does the job, but nothing impressive.  If I could do it again, I would buy the next series up.  Because it is quiet, I will always buy a Bosch.

The louder the spray, the quicker and better it cleans, These machines have no heating element, so the dishes never get dry. The machine was delivered new with water inside because the machine cannot dry even overnight even set to extra dry as there is no heat element in any Bosch model. It takes minimum 2 and one-half hours to 3 hours per cycle.  Cleans so-so. You must wash off food first and clean out food strainer at bottom daily.  This machine is so quiet you can’t tell it is on, but I liked my old Kenmore Quiet Guard better as it cleaned well and had heating element to dry well and was hundreds cheaper and completed cycle within one hour.

Pros: Very quiet, the third shelf is nice. The cycle done beeps are not loud, about the same as a digital watch, the manual tells how to turn it off (haven't done that). Have not heard the beeps at night from the BR and we have an open floor plan but I can hear the fridge icemaker. Dishes get clean.
Cons: Wish there was a countdown clock on the front and a dirty/clean indicator. The red floor LED is not good enough. Installation was a major pain due to the new type of connections (everything connects in back, not underneath), be prepared, if your DW is not next to the sink, it will be an extra challenge to properly install as you MUST have access to the adjacent cabinet to pull the slack in the hoses and wires back.

I like the extra (3rd) rack for laying sharp knives on and sundry other flat-tish utensils. It cleans very well as one would expect. However, I have been disappointed in it's drying ability. I always use the extra drying feature and it still leaves items wetter than my old machine. I believe it has something to do with new energy-saving guidelines. Also, initially, the smell of burning or burnt gas was awful. After some online searching I followed a suggestion to run dishwasher on high with 'extra dry' a few times without dishes. It made a difference but there's still some residual unpleasant odor after a cycle. I had to have an electrical outlet installed as this is now a standard requirement for all dishwashers. So that added to the installation cost. I arranged my own installation as Home Depot turned out to be ineffective in that department.  Can't comment on energy efficiency as I don't have the necessary equipment to gauge accuracy. I can only hope it is better than my old one.",80,"November 6, 2019"

Can't go wrong with the new top line, correct?? WRONG First the new top rack is USELESS. Silver doesn't fit any slot in it and is a jumbled mess. And unless you take out the top rack, any stemware will not fit... We removed it. Which leads to the second rack which Bosch engineers have managed to distort the wire rack so that it is almost impossibe to to get glasses to stack in any way shape or form.. And the 'adjustable' second rack mounting seems so flimsy it is sure not to last long. Bottom rack USELESS for dishes. ... Now here's the kicker.... After about 10 cycles E15 message and service call.. seems it LEAKS water into drain pan and auto shuts off .... Service guy.. he's OK.. cleans up water and runs it and finds no leak. 10 cycles later ... yup, E15 message ... Same result ... Now this is within 2 months. We now have red dye to run next ti me it happens to maybe show leak .... Service guy might be working on it out at the street trying to get my sledge hammer out of the xx#7! machine .....

Pros and Cons,"Pros:  Quiet to extreme--is it washing???, cleans well, top shelf moves easily for larger dishes to be placed in bottom rack. 
Cons:  Rack prongs too close together to load dishes properly. Does not dry plastic even after sitting overnight after wash even after using Extra Dry button.  If you add a dish after starting load, you must push start again. It does not automatically continue with the cycle when you close door. It will time out and leave you with dirty dishes. Glasses on either end of rack do not get washed inside properly since the top wash arm is not long enough to reach inside those. I avoid those 2 spaces when loading glasses. Silverware rack sits too far toward back to enable easily adding 1 piece of silverware to the rack. Bottom rack must be slid out a foot to add that piece of silverware. Door of dishwasher is heavy and requires force to open, lay flat, then allows ability for rack to slide forward. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]",80,"October 26, 2019"

Love this dishwasher,"This is my 4th Bosch dishwasher and I wouldn't have any other brand. Even when offered another brand that Is 'designer' pretty, I would still buy a Bosch. i love the stainless interior & I love the fact that it doesn't use a heating element for drying (even if that causes some wet pieces at the end of the cycle). This is the first dishwasher I've had with a 3rd rack, and I've found that to be very useful for those long, flatter objects that would ordinarily have to find spots between larger items on the lower racks. 
If I ever have to purchase another dishwasher, it will again be a Bosch. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]",100,"October 23, 2019"

Cleans well but don't leave dirty dishes in it,"I am happy with how well this dishwasher cleans my dishes and that it has the option to 'dry' them. My only issue is that when the dirty dishes sit for a few days while I accumulate a full load, it smells. I am unable to easily prop the door open a crack to let air circulate. So I rinse the dishes well but it can still get smelly. Don't know why I never had this problem with other dishwashers. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]",80,"October 22, 2019"
Very quiet but slow,"I'm told that this may be a problem with most (all?) modern dishwashwers in order to meet low water useage and energy efficiendy standards but in order to get rather dirty dishes cleaned, we need to use the Heavy setting, which takes almost 2 1/2 hours. Even the Normal wash is over 2 hours. This can be a problem when we have a dinner party and may need to do more that one load. Usually we run it overnight so it isn't a problem and its lack of noise is welcomed.",80,"October 22, 2019"

Dishwasher replacement,"I had to purchase a new dishwasher due to my only 4-year-old Whirlpool breaking down. After doing a little research I found that the Bosch had the best reviews for cleaning and reliability. The installation of the dishwasher was so much easier than my last one and the instructions were very easy to follow. After now using the dishwasher for a few weeks I can say that this unit is exactly what I was looking for. It cleans great, It dries everything very well and is a pretty quiet running unit. My only critique would be the rack slides do not seem to be as heavy duty as I would like and time will tell if they hold up to a family of 4 use. So far everything on this unit is working as I had hoped. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]",100,"October 22, 2019"

New Bosch Dishwasher,We sold our home and bought a condo.  The first thing we did was replace the dishwasher with a Bosch.   We had purchased a Bosch before and I loved it.

300 series Diswasher,"Great dishwasher. I miss the old less effecient models since they had faster cycles. now they use less water, run longer, and take longer to dry since they dont heat like the old ones either. This is the just the next generation of energy efficiant dishwashers. 

I like the third top tray and the way they have layed out the rest of the prongs for the dishes. It took a sec to figure out a new way of organizing the dishes, but now I really like it.

Installation was pretty easy once I figured out what fittings I needed to adapt to. The Power cord was included and I needed to do was take the electrical wire that was hardwired to my old one and terminate it into an electrical outlet in a box. Very basic electrical.

 All in all I really like it. Quiet, and washes dishes! [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]",100,"October 13, 2019"

The install was easy but it is pretty annoying that the $5 part that you’ll most likely need to connect the water line doesn’t come with the dishwasher. Also this dishwasher isn’t hardwired so to speak, it comes with a power cable that plugs into a regular outlet. There is a hardwire kit available but of course it is not included and is about $50.

Bosch dishwasher,Overall I really like the 300 series dishwasher. The outside looks beautiful and the stainless steel is easy to clean. We purchased it because it fits into a space slightly smaller than a standard dishwasher. There are 3 shelves for cleaning. We just washed a baseball cap on the top shelf without a cap mold and it came out perfect. The lower shelf holds a lot of plates. I find it difficult to load my bowls on the lower shelf is my only complaint. It is a very quiet dishwasher. I would recommend it.

Excellent upgrade,"We've had this washer for several weeks now.  It looks good inside and out, and the controls are intuitive and simple.  The design robustness and build quality are evident all over.  The thick insulation layer keeps the volume level super low and also keeps the countertop from heating up.  It's so quiet you can barely tell it's running if you don't look at the panel.  Does a good job cleaning and drying, and the third rack and adjustable height second rack are very useful features for flexibility.  We've just used the regular modes so far, not the smart/sensing modes yet, but it's a great upgrade from our previous dishwasher.

In absolute AWE of my new Bosch!,"When it came time to replace the antiquated GE dishwasher that came with the house we bought in April, we searched Computer Reports and other resources on the web.  I wanted QUIET.  I wanted EXCELLENT CLEANING.  I wanted a SHORTER than normal run time.  We checked out the online features and prices and kept coming back to Bosch.  Can we really afford a Bosch?  Yup!  We bought one of the lower priced models because we don't need all the bells and whistles.  For the two of us we just need top quality in a fairly basic machine.  Now I'm loving the QUIET when it runs.  I'm reveling in the 60 minute SHORT cycle, which cleans our dishes THOROUGHLY.

Good buy,The only reason I did not give it 5 stars is because it doesn't always dry everything as well as I think it should. Other than that I'm very happy with it. It is extremely quiet-almost silent. Fortunately there is a light that shines on the floor so you can tell when it is running. It cleans really well. Plenty of room for everything. I really like the 3rd rack for things that you can't figure out where else to put  such as spatulas. I like the fact that it has some fold down prongs adding flexibility to placement of items.

He said it was convenient to install and easy to replace, if ever needed. Does a fantastic job of cleaning dishes and drying them, we use mainly the auto cycle so far. Quiet too, which is great in a smaller home. Easy to load. We love the very top silverware rack, so much nicer to load and remove, than everything flopping around together.

Only one quibble in my 5 star rating,"Once we learned how best to load our Bosch (necessary with every change of appliance, of course) we complement ourselves on our good sense in buying this dishwasher.  Runs very quietly.  Love the digital display of time until done. Excellent cleaning.  Quibble: the silverware basket slots (of various sizes) often catch on our daily silverware when emptying after use. Our silverware is not, I believe, unusually large in handle-size or style than most others, yet I've taken to securing the entire bsket with my left hand and removing the silverware with my right in order to keep from  lifting the basket and upsetting it, dumping all onto the counter.

I purchased at Home Depot and had it delivered and old unit taken away. I did purchase a three year additional product plan for a reasonable cost. $105 .All in all after the discounts was reasonable I guess.
Delivery was on they day they mentioned but was very late past 6pm. The contracted delivery personal was fine but loaded down with too many stops. Not there fault I know the transportation business very well and they just load these guys up and don't care.
Installed with a friend and checked for leaks. None. Simple instructions and fit like a glove. This this is so and ran like a top. It does seem to have an issue with moisture after dishes are done. Will need to address this going forward. This is the first time purchasing a dishwasher at this price point and was quite shocked to see. However, unit is quite impressive and looks great. No issues to date about two weeks.",100,"September 30, 2019"

What a lovely dishwasher!,"We have only had our Bosch a short time, but it has changed our dish routine for the better. Perfect clean, very little noise, great dry when the “extra dry” button is used. Love that the time is displayed so we know how much longer it has to go. Easy filter cleaning. No musty smells so far.

After many days of research I  purchased this Bosh...,After many days of research I  purchased this Bosh dishwasher in Sept. 2019.  Directions tell you to scrape off your dishes but not rinse them.  I do not ever put dishes in the dishwasher that I have not rinsed off.  Yuk! Anyway I have used this dishwasher twice.  It seems to clean dishes ok and it is very quiet.  However no matter what cycle I choose to use it does not dry the dishes even using the Extra Dry function.  In my opinion this is not acceptable.  Having  the inside of an appliance always wet can cause problems with mildew and having to dry your dishes by hand is not what I expected.  Also the red light on the botton which indicates the appliance  is on does not go off after the dishes are done. Therefore I would not recommend this product. If possible I would return this dishwasher;.and yes this is a real review.,60,"September 10, 2019"

Pretty poor for a so called high end appliance,"I expected a better performer from a company that marks itself as a maker of high end products.  The upper silver ware  rack does a poor job of keeping the individual pieces stable during drawer movement and during the cycle. The unit is noisy during drain cycles also.   The biggest issue is the fact that the unit does not even come close to drying the dishes regardless whether I have it on the extra dry cycle or not. My previous dishwasher was an LG and it was fantastic in loading, washing, drying and overall quietness.  The Bosch misses those marks with the exception that it does a reasonable job on cleaning dishes that have been rinsed well prior to loading.",40,"September 8, 2019"

I haven't had one dish yet with food still stuck on - even after the 60 min cycle. All my dishes are bone dry (i do use Jet Dry) and it is SO QUIET!!!

Would be a great DW for a large family.  Did I say how quiet it is?  Only know it is running when I hear it draining.  Really like the 3rd rack, able to put plastics etc that took up so much room in previous DW.  Love the look, modern but still looks nice with my not so modern kitchen.  The only clinch was my house is hard wired and the Bosch DW did not come with an adapter, only a plug in cord.  And since I was not installing it I did not know this.  Was able to get one thru Bosch complimentary, only delay the final installation by a few days.   Really am happy I went with Bosch.",100,"August 28, 2019"
especially well designed,Love all the options with this dishwasher like the third tier just for utensils. Lots of flexibility in adjustments in both the height of the 2nd tier and the placement of dividers. I've noticed our glasses come out much cleaner than our old dishwasher.

Exceptional Cleaning and Very Quiet,"This is my 2nd Bosch dishwasher. When we sold our previous home, it was the one thing I missed. Even though our new home had a new dishwasher, I decided to replace it because I missed how well our Bosch dishwasher cleaned and especially how quiet it is. The new upper rack for utensils like spatulas and long spoons is an excellent feature. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]",100,"August 27, 2019"

Shiny dishes!,"Every review site loved this dishwasher, and now that I own one, I understand why. It is so quiet that I usually cannot tell that it's running, and the dishes come out clean and even shiny! This is also my first dishwasher with a third rack, for silverware and serving tools.  My only complaints are because I did not want to spend the extra money for the 500 series. The racking is less adjustable, ant the controls are on the front panel, rather than concealed. It's a great dishwasher at this mid-level price. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]",100,"August 25, 2019"
Bosch 300 Series Dishwasher,Excellent build quality.  Good capacity.  Logical and user friendly controls. Cleans very well and very quiet. Only issue is there is a slight oil like smell inside the unit. I was told this would disappear after a few washes. However we have used it for a month and the odor has not gone away.

LOVE MY BOSCH!,"I absolutely love my new Bosch dishwasher! The functionality, reliability, maintance and appearance are outstanding. My old dishwasher had a non-removable food-waste filter that was difficult to clean. My new Bosch has a stainless steel interior and removable filter. The biggest change was the drying method. The Bosch does not have a heat element for drying. I can wash my plastic items without worrying they will be damaged (like happened a few times in my old washer!) LOVE MY BOSCH!

Our Super Duper Bosch Dishwasher,"We are SO happy with our new Bosch Dishwasher - We actually argue over who can fill it/ unload it, etc.  It is such a fabulous machine with many features we have never had on previous dishwashers.  We love that 3rd upper rack where we can put items that are difficult to find a place for, such as butter dishes, serving spoons, spatulas, ice cream scoops, etc.

You can go mad reading them all, because you'll find bad reviews on every single one. What we have found with this dishwasher (after 2 weeks) is that the reviews have been accurate.
1) It is EXTREMELY quiet
2) The normal cycle is EXTREMELY long (2 hrs 45 min)
3) The dishes and tub are still quite wet when the cycle is complete (even after leaving the door closed for hours)
4) The dishes are clean

Installation review:
1) We were replacing an existing dishwasher, so plumbing and electric hook-ups existed
2) Install team couldn't connect plumbing (need permit) and won't connect electrical (because it's hard wired); therefore, I did not opt to pay $150 for them to do nothing more than the free delivery. Home Depot informed me of this ahead of time, so there is no issue with Home Depot on this.
3) The dishwasher comes with a cord to plug into an outlet, but if you have a hardwired connection (like we do) you MUST purchase a BOSCH junction box accessory cord for $20. Not an issue, except it has a TWO WEEK lead time (dishwasher arrived in 3 days)
4) Connections for utilities are at the back of the dishwasher, which is nice
5) Installation was pretty simple.

It's an expensive dishwasher, let's hope it lasts!",80,"August 23, 2019"

Amazing Machine!,"I researched several Dishwashers and I always came back to the Bosch. Im so glad i bought it. It has been an amazing machine these several months Ive had it. I have zero issues!!

Very quiet machine,We have used this dishwasher for almost a year now. It is extremely quiet. My wife sitting in the next room did not believe me when I said it was running. Only drawbacks we have experienced are the lack of a large space pots and the occasional aroma if the door is shut for a while with dirty dishes inside as we do not run it every day.

BOSCH Dishwasher,"We had to replace our old dishwasher and this new BOSCH is more than I expected.  I really like the top drawer for silverware; never had that feature in a product before.  One of my pet peeves are when the organization of the pull-out trays (especially bottom) don't accommodate a variety of dish sizes.  This BOSCH is great, both bottom shelf and middle shelf have enough storage that packs efficiently, so we don't have to wash as often.  I've never purchased BOSCH before, and I'm sold!

Gets dishes so clean!!,"This is hands down the BEST dishwasher I have ever owned. It is shocking how clean everything is. I followed the instructions reluctantly to not prewash the dishes. I just scrape everything off into the trash and then pop them into my Bosch, unless something is baked on of course. They come out sparkling every time.

Quite a Quiet Experience,"We are extremely satisfied with the purchase of our Bosch dishwasher! We replaced an upgraded Whirlpool dishwasher that came standard with our newly built home.

So quiet.,"Our new Bosch dishwasher is so quiet that sometimes we forget that it's running. It does a fantastic job of cleaning the dishes too. We feel that the above two issues are the most important. We are still getting used to the dry cycle since there is no heating element so we use the ""extra dry"" setting and usually that does the trick. Overall it's a great dishwasher.

Best appliance in the house,"We had an LG dishwasher which lasted all of two years before it developed all sorts of problems. We went shopping for a new one and settled for a Bocsh 300 Series. It is by far the best appliance in our kitchen. It is well built (sturdy), has a good appearance (outside finish) and is extremely easy to use, leaves the dishes spotless without havig to spend gallons of water rinsing them off first. Place your dirty dishes straight from the table (without food scraps) and they will come out absolutely spotless. It has a choice of using the cutlery baskets on bottom rack, or, if you have a dinner party, use the cutlery rack at the very top. Works beautifully! This machine is so quiet that unless you see the control panel lights on, you would never know it was working. Great appliance, best ever!

"I'm basing this review on my experiences with my previous dishwasher, a nine year old Bosch 500 s...","I'm basing this review on my experiences with my previous dishwasher, a nine year old Bosch 500 series that required very expensive repairs (first and only problem by the way). This model really is worth five stars, more on that later. The good: excellent cleaning performance, very quiet, good drying on glass, china and metal if you can catch the ""end-of-cycle"" and partially open the door. Third upper drawer very handy for small items and knives and allow you to remove the flatware basket to increase space for large items. The not so good: No end of cycle sound which I really miss, Opening the dishwasher when it finishes allows moisture to evaporate from the very hot items and dry very well, even from most plastic ware. If you miss the end of cycle, some plastic item will need light towel drying, the rest will be fine. The dividers in the baskets have less movable tines than my older model but I have adapted. Drain pump seems to make more noise, not the pump, but the sound of the water splashing in the pipe (pump seems more powerful), but this is a minor issue. 

The main reason for loosing a star was installation, I replaced a Bosch with a Bosch. Should be easy right! Wrong! Power connection is a dedicated cord to an outlet, old unit was ""hard wired."" No space behind unit for an outlet box, unit is too deep. Installation instructions require an outlet box installed in an adjoining cabinet to the right side, cord is at the bottom right rear and while more than adequate in length in that direction, it would be a challenge in the other direction. Other than electrical, installation is fairly simple, but no 90 degree elbow is provided for the water line but it's required and listed as such in the installation instructions. Not expensive, but it's another trip for a simple part that would be easy to provide..",80,"August 13, 2019"

I also like the third upper rack. It allows me to take out the silverware basket and fit more large bowls down below.

quiet & capable,"Wow - significantly quieter!  We were slightly hesitant to take the leap based on varied reviews of the drying or lack of drying.  So glad we did.  Our dishes are noticably cleaner than AND dryer than the model it replaced (which was only 2yrs old).  Love the 3rd rack to free up more space.  The stacking of dishes and layout of the tines is pretty different so seems weird at first.  Still trying to figure out it's intent and do the best job getting dishes in, but no big deal.  When cycle is over, the disply stays lit - with 00's I think - so if you open it, then close it the display resets as if you want to start a new cycle so need to press the on/off button to make that stop.  It's just a little weird.  Overall great appliance purchase and I would recommend to others [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]",100,"August 8, 2019"
Amazingly clean,"We upgraded from a 12-year dishwasher to the Bosch and were stunned by how clean the dishes, especially glassware, came out of the machine. Follow the directions on detergent and rise aide and you will be amazed. It's also reasonably quiet and easy to use. Did I mention how dang clean it gets the glasses?

My glasses/glassware are getting clearer, not as cloudy as before. I purchased the Bosch about a month ago. I do use the Extra Dry feature to make sure everything dries. Learned to make sure big spoons are turn down when using the 3rd rack, so water doesn't pool. I read the reviews and agree that it's worth the extra cost. I had a stainless steel tub dishwasher in my other house and moved into a new home without a stainless, missed it for the past 7 years. So happy to have made this purchased.",100,"August 7, 2019"

"Absolutely top-notch quality, design","Like many folks, I've owned a few brands of dishwashers over the years.  This is my first Bosch.  And now, I'm wondering why I didn't go with Bosch a long time ago.  The impeccable quality, funtional build and anticipated durability became very evident from the first wash.  Spotless dishes, 3 racks and dry dishes - ready to load in the cupboard.  Take the guesswork out of it (and follow major ratings sources) and buy a Bosch.

"Great Machine, Much Better than the old one","Our old dishwasher did a pretty good job of getting the dishes clean (or so we thought). But we had to replace it because it was making a loud grinding noise. We did our research and found that CR had about 9 Bosch units in their top 10. We went to our local appliance people, who were very helpful, and chose this model because it had a visible display. The installation was quick and easy. When the installation tech turned it on we were amazed at how quiet it is. If it weren't for the display, you wouldn't know it was on. My wife absolutely LOVES the 3rd rack and comments on it every time she uses it. But the best part was how much cleaner the dishes are, especially the red wine glasses. My wife used hand wash them sometimes because of the stain on the glass if left overnight. Now they come out crystal clear, using the same soap and rinse agent. This is one of our better investments.

Our previous Bosch lasted 15 years, so it is definitely our brand of choice. This one has the connections on the back of the unit, which makes a lot of sense to us. We're glad we could find a model with the buttons and display visible when the door is closed - this design gives it a slightly retro-look, which we like.

Excellent Diswasher,"The diswasher that came with our house broke in its second year of use. We replaced it with the same model mainly because of price and it matched our other appliances. Well after two years, the replacement broke as well. I was determined to buy a reliable dishwasher. I did a lot of research and settled on the Bosch SHEM63@55N because it was the perfect combination of reliablility, performance, and price. It was more expensive than our previous brand, but the extra money has been well worth it. It does a great job of washing and drying the dishes as well as being extremely quite, especially compared to our last dishwasher that sounded like a jet flying throug the kitchen.

Delivery and customer service personnel were very helpful in correcting the botched up details of the order process.
Apparently all Bosch dishwashers are designed and built with no heated dryer for the end of the cycle. This was NOT mentioned in any on-line descriptions. There were all manners of claims about features that improved drying, including the possibility of increased power consumption, but no clear mention of the lack of an actual dryer.

The stainless front is beautiful and the controls very easy to use. It's incredibly quiet!! We installed ourselves and the instructions were very clear and it wasn't hard. I'd say most people can save the $100+ for install. We like all the wash options. We usually use the 60-minute speed wash to save energy and it gets dishes clean, even pots that don't have food caked on. I like the adjustable upper rack, but the top (3rd) rack isn't very useful. It doesn't always get silverware clean, even on the longer cycle - I think the spray doesn't get up there very effectively. We do use it for large cooking utensils and plasticware lids. Mostly we use the basket for silverware, it holds a lot of silverware. As others said, there is a slight odor after washing but it seems to be fading. Also, plastics stay wet, although we haven't used the high-heat setting, as we want to save energy. We either let the washer sit open to air dry or put the plastics in the rack in the sink to dry. Our main problem in all this was in making the order on the Home Depot website. It seemed buggy, and it never gave me a way to say we wanted the washer installed. It also gave two choices of equipment you might need for the install, but didn't provide the information to help you know which you needed. I tried calling the customer service number and it kept hanging up on me, both before and after someone picked up. I tried the chat function and the guy couldn't see that there was no installation option. The delivery guy said another customer had complained about this. I spent WAY too long making this order.

"I love, love, love, my new Bosch dishwasher!",I've had a KitchenAid dishwasher for many years and they are great. The one I just replaced was 30 years old and still running but some break down of the upper rack.  I found out the Bosch was a top brand and reviews were great so I went for it.  I couldn't believe that a dishwasher could be so quiet with water spraying around inside.  I also love the size. It holds quite a bit more dishes than my old Kitchenaid.  Great if you have a big family but I'm by myself so I can go a couple days without running it... and maybe longer if I didn't run out of dishes!  I use the extra rack at the very top for my silverware and they come out shining.  The glasses are super clear and everything comes out shiny clean.

Didn't think I would use the third shelf very much because I thought there could not be much cleaning at that upper level - wrong I was - cleans great and I find it a nice convenience for stuff that does not fit well in the lower levels.  We pretty much run this on the quick wash (one hour) rather than the normal program, which can go two hours, since everything always comes out clean.  (With our old dishwasher, we always ran it at the longest pots & pans setting.)  It does get very very hot inside the unit, so we quickly understood the importance of the manufacturer's instructions not to put any plastics in the lowest level.  
Yeah, this was marginally more expensive than some other models, but it is worth it.  
I hope it stays as reliable as its initial performance.

Only minor negative note is  the installation instructions for the side bracket connections to the wood cabinet.  The graphic is impossible to comprehend and I had to go to youtube to finally get it figured out.  Not a big deal, just a bit of extra time to install.",100,"June 27, 2019"

There are quieter models but I can not hear this one in the next room. Two things I love a little less: First, the buttons are actual buttons not smooth panel buttons, seemed kinda old school to me. Second, if you set the delay start timer, and some one opens it to add another dish, you have to hit start again to get the timed delay going again otherwise it just won't run. 

DIY'ers: You'll need a 3/4"" x 3/8"" dishwasher elbow to connect your water supply. And the electrical is a bit trickier than most dishwashers. I actually like the design better but it's a different way to wire up an appliance than normal in the U.S.

I'm delighted with the Bosch dishwasher!  Dishes come out very clean, which I would expect.  The noise level when washing is extremely quiet, not expecting quite as quiet as it is.  That's great!  I can get many more dishes in than my old machine which is wonderful as well.  I really like the 3rd drawer for washing flat items.  I put all my knives there so that the silverware basket will work longer.  The only slightly negative thing is that some of the dishes don't dry as much as I like.

Improvements are needed,"Kept noticing the water left on the bottom of the cups was foggy and had dirt specs in the water after the dishwasher cleaned them. Solution - had to run very lightly solied loads on the heavy load cycle to help this problem. The normal or automatic modes appear to be too much of an energy saver - not using enough water to throughly rinse. Upper flat tray appears to be blocking the next tray down from getting rinsed with plenty of water from above. You can't angle some bowls in the bottom tray even with using the adjustable pegs. You have to crack the door open after clean in order to dry off the dishes. Otherwise, water remains that didn't evaporate if you wait until machine cools down.
Very quiet while running. However, would rather hear all kinds of water spraying noise so you know the dishes are being throughly washed / rinsed. Seems the wash arms do not spin really fast. Plumber checked water pressure and it's set above the dishwasher's min. pressure requirement.",40,"June 14, 2019"

Cleans well with little water and long spray arms, but a long cycle time. Third rack fits shallow and long items. Racks are well designed for plates and other items.

4.5 out of 5- Almost perfection with a few flaws,"This dishwasher is great in SO many ways. It's whisper quiet, you don't even realize it's on for 3/4 of the cycle and the rest of the cycle sounds like a fireplace roaring quietly. The dishes turn out sparkling clean, and it looks very nice in my kitchen. I LOVE the little 3rd rack for big utensils and flat items because it frees up a ton of space for other things on the main racks. I also really utilize the way that the bottom rack is laid out. It holds about 1.5 times the amount of plates/bowls my old dishwasher did.

My 2 complaints:

1. It had an awful rotten food smell the first few weeks whenever we opened it. I don't know if old water was stuck in the pipes or the seal was too perfect? it has dissipated some but for a while it was so bad we had to plug our noses while emptying.

2. There is no designated place for the dry finishing powder part of the soap. After reading online we see that they say to sprinkle 1-2tsp on the floor of the dishwasher but I feel like it isn't doing it's job that way. It would be nice if there were a little pocket.

Definitely would  (and I did) recommend to other people. This is a top notch machine. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]",80,"June 8, 2019"

"Great washer, a little pricey","I did a lot of research before deciding on this particular washer. Although the reviews were glowing, there were many people complaing about the dishes not coming out dry. Although that did concern me, the manufactures response put me at a cautious ease. I had it installed by the delivery techs and they did a good job. After the first wash it was clear that when the manufacturers instructions are followed, the dishes will come out bone dry. There was a bit of condenstation on the inside surface of the door, but that minimized after a few washes. The top utensil tray could be better designed. It holds the thin utensils solidly in place but not the larger handles. luckily the bottom utensil basket works great without severely limiting capacity. The only build issue I have is the door is not rigid on the hinges. It can be twisted slightly in opposite direction from the top corners. The machine is whisper silent, the only sound i hear in the water running through the pipes at the begining. All in all im very happy with the purchase and would highly recommend it.",80,"June 4, 2019"

In a way there are too many options with the folding tines, up or down, the rack dropping or not. I can fit much less in this dishwasher than my prior Maytag for some odd reason, even though it is the same basic size. The cleaning power is amazing, it is very easy to keep clean. My only complaint is loading as I just can't fit as much in. I miss a basket to put small things in but I can buy a freestanding one I guess. Overall a terrific dishwasher.

HORRIBLE HORRIBLE HORRIBLE Dishwasher!!! We recently made 2 very grave errors in judgement. First...,"HORRIBLE HORRIBLE HORRIBLE Dishwasher!!! We recently made 2 very grave errors in judgement. First, we made the mistake of buying this dishwasher from Home Depot. Unlike others, Home Depot does NOT give you any time at all to try an appliance to make sure it works the way it’s supposed to!  You can find ones with a 14 or 30 day “no questions asked” return policy, but not Home Depot.  Apparently with Home Depot, once it’s delivered it’s yours. That was mistake number 1. Mistake number 2 was buying this Bosch Series 300 dishwasher. We just bought a home and needed to replace some of the kitchen appliances, including the dishwasher. I read a lot of reviews from many different sources, and while almost every dishwasher has both pluses and minuses, this Bosch seemed to get good reviews. I think all the reviews must have been written by Bosch employees since most people seemed to like the way it cleaned as well as how dry the dishes were after the cycle was done . . . something that seems to be a big problem with today’s “modern” appliances. The dishwasher cleans just fine. And while I’m not that crazy about the way the racks are angled and placed, that’s not the biggest problem. The biggest problem that is my main reason for giving it such a horrible review, is that at the end of the cycle, everything inside – including the inside of the door and the walls – is just as wet as if I had stopped the dishwasher in the middle of the cycle! It doesn’t dry AT ALL!!! I have been married for over 40 years and have always owned a dishwasher. I have NEVER had such a problem with things being dry at the end as I’ve had with this unit, and I put the same mix of items into the dishwasher that I have always used one for, pots, pans, lids, Tupperware/Rubbermaid containers and lids, glassware, silverware and of course, dishes. Up until we bought this Bosch, we might have a tiny bit of water left inside the edge of a Tupperware lid, but certainly not everything absolutely dripping both inside and out! We have tried everything. First, since we have never needed to use any kind of rinse aid, we tried the dishwasher without it. We tried the “Normal” cycle, we tried the “Auto” cycle, we tried “Extra Dry” (that one’s a laugh – slightly less wet might be more like it . . . ), and we’ve tried “Sanitize”. We’ve tried everything and every possible combination, even breaking down and trying all the same options with the rinse aid. NOTHING WORKS! After trying various cycles for about a week, I called Home Depot only to be told “It’s yours . . . there’s nothing we can do for you now”, and that I should have called within 48 hours. No one ever mentioned that to us when we bought it, no one ever gave us the phone number to call at Bosch if we had a problem, nor did we get any information at all about the extended 5 year warranty we had purchased on the unit. No brochure, no paperwork, nothing. I certainly never heard about any 48 hour limit, and I was trying to give every option a chance to see if we could come up with something that would help. The manager gave me the number for Bosch so I called them. They arranged for an authorized repair dealer in our area to come out who told me this is “normal” for these new airtight, energy efficient machines and that I shouldn’t be putting any plastic into it. First of all, if the unit is so airtight that no steam or condensation can escape, why isn’t there some kind of vent or something that opens at the end of the cycle so that it CAN escape??? Duh – that would be a no-brainer. Oh, wait, the whole unit is a NO BRAINER! PureDry? That’s a laugh . . . and a very expensive one at that. Also, since I’ve been cleaning our Tupperware/Rubbermaid containers in the dishwasher for the past 40+ years, why should I have to stop now? What good is a dishwasher that doesn’t wash and dry the dishes you use? The last home we were in before our move had a new, bottom of the line Frigidaire unit in it, and that one came out almost completely dry - plastic containers and all! This Bosch cost twice as much and doesn’t dry a darn thing. The only way we can even get it somewhat dry is to time the cycle so that it ends when I get up in the morning so I can make sure I can open the door partway within 5 minutes of it ending to let the steam and condensation out. And I have to set a separate timer for when it’s going to end as it’s so quiet it’s very easy to forget about. What a pain!!!! I would highly recommend you buy a different machine if you want something decent.  I would like this one to be replaced with a different brand or my money back. It just doesn’t do what it’s supposed to do!!!",20,"May 30, 2019"

Quality Product,We have had our Bosch dishwasher since April.  The pros: (1) easy to load with extra spaces; (2) quiet.

Expected More,"I thought I would have liked everything about the name Bosch, but I’m sorry to say this dishwasher disappointed me.  It doesn’t do a very good job of drying no matter what buttons are pushed.  It also has had an unpleasant odor since day one.  And to top it off it is a challenge to load normal glass tumblers so they are not standing strait up.  I’m used to having them on an angle for the water to run off. And you cannot just load without some form of rinsing unless you don’t care how clean your dishes will be. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]",60,"May 23, 2019"

Nice Washer,"Replaced a 15 year old Bosch with this stainless version. Installation: Connections are in the back as opposed to the front with the old unit. Also comes with a junction box that will not fit in the dishwasher space. Not sure what use the junction box serves. Just adds to the complexity of the install. Not a difficult install, just took more time and effort. Operation: Little noise as most have stated. Programming took several attempts but I'm not computer savy. Haven't yet figured out best way to load. I don't use the top rack for silverware. Spatulas, tongs, large utensils maybe. Many complaints about smell, lack of adequite drying. I have no issues. There was a ""factory"" smell that is gone. Dishes are clean and dry. I have progamed sanitize and extra dry options and use a rinse aid. Overall I'm satisfied. I hope it lasts.

I have not noticed any left over residue after washing. The dishes, glassware, and cutlery come out very clean. The nearly hidden at the top of unit- third rack for long untensils is great! Unfortunately, no heated dry so dishes are partially wet/wet when cycle is complete. Does require rinse aid solution to be refilled every few weeks in addition to the usual per load detergent pod. The 2 main racks have angled tines so it takes some trial and error to figure out best loading configuration. The 2 main racks have some handy adjustable features to hold items. The cutlery basket is easy to access and remove. I give the unit a 4/5 star rating. I would recommend this dishwasher.",80,"May 15, 2019"

Awesome Dishwasher!,"This is hands down the best dishwasher we have ever owned, and unfortunately we've had quite a few non-Bosch ones. We've had this Bosch dishwasher for a couple of months, and every time we've used it (which averages about twice a day), all the dishes and utensils come out spotless. We've had a few dishwashers that did a nice job initially, but they were nothing like this Bosch. My only regret is that we didn't buy this dishwasher years ago (assuming it was even available then). This is also the first dishwasher we've owned where we trust and only use the auto cycle. It takes about 2 hours to run on the auto cycle, but it still appears to use little energy (at least based on our electricity and water bills). And the dishes come out smelling nicely as well, as you can tell by the steam released when opening the door that this dishwasher sanitizes very well. This dishwasher is amazing. We highly recommend this dishwasher. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]",100,"May 13, 2019"

"Extremely quiet, attractive, good cleaning","Like the Bosch dishwasher.  A couple of improvements would make it much better.  Pull out drawer for us is not useful.  One forgets you have anything in there, and items don't dry too well on that rack.  There is moisture on the door most times after the cycle is over.  Not sure why this is so.  Dishwasher performs better with Cascade liquid then Finish pellets or gelcaps.  The gelcaps did not remove tea stains from the tea cups, but Cascade did.

Bosch is the BEST,Never had I realized there was such a marvelous dishwasher being sold. This dishwasher is the quietest ever! It loads so nicely. The racks tilt to accommodate large items. It’s great for my large baking dish and other pots and pans. The top rack lines up silverware so you don’t have to sort them when putting the away. All my dishes are sparkling clean when it’s finished. No water drops and everything’s dry ready to put away. It’s a little pricey but you get what you pay for. It’s a great machine and I’m sure it’s going service my family for years to come. Love it. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.],100,"May 12, 2019"

satisfied,"I am happy wwithe the purchase of the Bosch 300 series dishwasher. It was easy to install, but I had to purchace an adaptor for the discharge hose because the hose was1/2 inch and my garbage disposal had a 3/4 inch pipe. The dishes get very clean but they do require a short period of air time to finish drying after the cycle is over. I open the door for 15 Minuits to do this. A minor inconvience compared to the old dishwasher that I replaced.I like the countdown clock that tells me how much time isleft in the wash cycle. the main reason for buying this dishwasher was the leak bucket on the bottom that will allert when there is a leak and shut down the dishwasher. My old dishwasher had a leak and mold devdloped under it before I was aware of it causing me to have to do a mold removal and a floor replacement. The hazard warnings that came with the instructions caused a lot of worry for my daughter. They need to be better written. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]",80,"May 8, 2019"

The dishes are squeaky clean and it's quiet.  A good compromise with most of the features of the 500 series but with a better price.

Found: The Perfect Dishwasher!,"After three months, I couldn’t be happier with my new dishwasher. The outside is sleek and elegant, and the stainless steel interior is clean and easy to see.  I love the simplicity of the display in full view, with clear lighted choices; plus, the machine is both easy to start and instantly stopped if necessary. Instructions are explicit, with lots of smart tips and suggestions. The rinse aid, a new feature for me, is a definite bonus – every glass comes out squeaky dry. There’s a wealth of choices, whether it’s just us or an extended-family dinner, with several wash cycles and flexibility in loading, like flip tines, an adjustable upper rack and special supports for stemware. I appreciate the fact that a single feature adapts to more than one purpose – for instance, the 3rd rack is great for long or wide utensils, and can also be removed for extra space to accomodate tall items. And finally, the SILENCE is sweet – never dreamed a dishwasher could be so quiet! [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]",100,"April 30, 2019"

Although we are still getting used to new configurations for our dishes and glassware, they come out clean and very shiny. It is quality made - especially the heavy, sturdy door. Because we slightly rinse our dishes first, we are able to use the Speed60 cycle and it works fine. We are still unsure how to fit bigger bowls into the racks, but we keep experimenting. We will try putting all silverware in the narrow top rack instead of the silverware holder, which will free up space.

Dishwasher,I like that it is very quiet and that the dishes  get very clean. Not sure yet if i like the 3rd shelf. I dont like that when done it does not automatically shut off. The dishes do not dry entirely even though i press extra dry. And the interior stays wet and seams like it could breed bacteria. Thus only 3 stars [This review was collected as part of a promotion.],80,"April 22, 2019"

Completely Satisfied,"After looking at many reviews, my wife and I decided on this brand and this model to replace our short-lived GE brand.  It has a large 
capacity, so much so that we nearly run out of dishes and cookware before it is filled. We particularly like the top (third) rack that holds knives, measuring spoons, lids, and other small items.  Most importantly, the dishes come out sparkling clean!  To be sure they come out clean, we follow all of the directions removing chunks and using the rinse aid. Also, we regularly clean the screen. Be prepared for this dishwasher to take about two hours to cycle through the wash.  We highly recommend this dishwasher. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]",100,"April 8, 2019"

Far and Away the Best Dishwasher I've Owned,"Got this to replace an older Bosch, which was a great machine in and of itself; this 300 Series unit is easily the best dishwasher I've ever owned or used.  Not dead silent like the more expensive machines but still barely audible; excellent selection of cycles and options; so much room for dishes and silverware; flexible loading options; and does an outstanding job cleaning the dishes!
Installation was pretty simple even when replacing a 12 year old Bosch - but make sure you buy a new hot water hose and adapter.
My favorite feature is the third row silverware rack - saves even more space and makes unloading incredibly quick - just group each size of utensil together and then scoop them out in a batch.
Overall just an excellent purchase - and so much room we've probably cut back our number of times running it per week by a third. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]",100,"April 4, 2019"

This information was not in their instruction manual. Found out that younger to disconnect then hoses and pressure then out plus clean the filters. I am 62 years old and have no means to do this so I will have to call someone. I understand this happens every few months. Really Bosch!!!! I had a dishwasher for 14 years and this never happened. I would not recommend. Check out the you tube before you buy to see you want to do this all the time. Also I don’t like that when the dishwasher goes off there is no light to tell you it is done. When you open it then you remember that you ran it and see the dishes are clean. I would never recommend this now I will have to clean my dishes before they go in and have an ongoing cost of $200 to get some to come to clean the hoses everytime I get an error code.,20,"March 31, 2019"

A Little Noisier Than I'd Expected,"The flat bottom of the Bosch required a rerouting of the electrical connection; the previous dw had a hollow bottom so the wiring had come up through the center of the floor opening.  The noise is more apparent when the water is discharging into the pipes below the sink.  The ANGLE of the tines works well for dishes, not so well for cutting boards and trays and objects without a lip.  The third rack for silverware limited the height of objects put into the second rack, so we've removed it and adjusted the second rack for maximum height.  Abt promised a free cleaner for the stainless steel door, but it was not included.  Design of the rinse aid dispenser makes it difficult to load without spilling. I've heard modern dishwashers don't have the same reliability of old dishwashers; I'm hoping for the best.  Dishes have come out very clean so far.

I bought this dishwasher for the condensation drying system and the adjustable lower tines. After...,"I bought this dishwasher for the condensation drying system and the adjustable lower tines. After I ran the first load of dishes, the bottom of the dishwasher was standing in water. I tried again on a different cycle. The inside of the dishwasher drum was covered with condensation after the cycle was completed. I tried again on a different cycle and used the extended drying feature. It was no better. Also, when I pulled out the racks to empty the dishes, water from the runners poured all over my clean dishes and I had to them hand dry them. So, I read complaints about the drying system. The bottom line is, it doesn't work. The entire dishwasher stays dripping wet. I don't mean the dishes, I mean the unit itself. And, the high-tech solution is that you have to leave the dishwasher open to finish drying the unit out. And, you can't do it before 30 minutes after the cycle ends or over 2 hours later, and then you have to leave the unit open for 2 hours. REALLY!! I just don't have time to mess with that. Also, I live in a humid climate. I figure, after a while, something is going to mildew. Some have tried to say that more liquid drying agent was needed. I can assure you, that absolutely would not dry out this dishwasher. The bottom line is, condensation drying systems do not work. So, I sent this one back and got a dishwasher with a heated drying cycle, like they've always had. Going green is one thing, but my dishes turning green from mold and mildew is quite another. I do not recommend any dishwasher with a condensation drying system.",20,"March 14, 2019"

Best Dishwasher We Ever Prchased,"We purchased this dishwasher on December 20 of 2018. We have lived in our home for 35 years and owned 3 dishwashers; this one being number 3.
It is absolutely the best dishwasher we have ever owned. It cleans the best, uses less detergent and is QUIET. So quiet you could take a nap beside it while it is running. The only thing I think you could improve is the silverware basket. The slots are not all the same size and a lot of our utensils have thick handles and don’t fit. Thankfully there is that pull out rack at the top for large serving spoons etc. So we put the problem silverware up there. This is  minor issue but it would still be nice to see it addressed. We LOVE this machine! [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]",100,"March 5, 2019"

It’s a quality appliance that seems to have been designed well. Even looks great, front controls, quiet, stainless tub, etc... Hopefully it continues to perform for years to come.

Best dishwasher during our 63 years fo marriage *,"My wife and I (has I help more and more in the kitchen) believe this to be the best design, quite, and most featured dishwasher we have ever owned in our 63 years of marriage.  To be honest however, we had our first dishwasher (other than 2 kids) in 1965.  In the service we moved a lot and so have had quite a few different brands of dishwashers.
My son turned us on to the Bosch brand, as they have several of Bosch appliances.  What we like best about this dishwasher is the style, how quite it is, and it's features.  We particularly like the Delay, variety of loads supported, and the sanitize features. 
When we replace our other appliances we will definitely consider Bosch brand. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]",100,"March 1, 2019"

It's quiet,"I've had this washer 5 weeks now. Install was a breeze. It cleans great and lives up to the decimals level. Washers have changed in 8 years I assume. I say that because I'm use to a true drying cycle without any issues. Unless you open to air dry get the towel. It washes great that's it. Some said the sanitizing cycle would do it, nope. The unidentified smell after a load is another issue no one seems to be able to correctly address.
Some say its mold which it isn't. It smelled from day one. I have run bleach and vinegar thru with no luck.If I dont open as soon ad the cycle finishes the dishes smell.  This is why I can't give it 5 stars.  These machine aren't cheap. I likely wouldn't buy it again. Besides there are other brands now that are almost as quiet which I would gladly trade for the wet dishes and that smell. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]",60,"February 6, 2019"

The overall construction of the unit is very cheap. There is a fair amount of low grade plastic integrated into the design and the metal parts are very flemsy. For example, the water inlet connection is plastic and is inegrated onto a plastic cover that is only held in place by small retaining clips. You definitely want ot use a flexible water line. Even with a flexible line, the turning force exerted on the inlet connection pushes the retaining clips to their breaking limit. The parts with some metal are not any better. For example, the front loading door flexes like a cheap cookie sheet.

As far as the operation of the dishwasher, it has lots of room and is quiet. However, if you want your dishes to be dry after a wash cycle you'll have to use a chemical additive to make this happen. Without it, the dishes come out dripping with water.

If you are looking for a great dishwasher for the money, the Bosch 300 is not it. Save your money and go with a lower cost unit that will have a better chance of meeting your expectations.",20,"January 16, 2019"

Numerous attempts by service personnel who didn’t bring the proper water supply hoses or correct drain hose to install this unit.  I think there are communication issues between your departments.",100,"January 1, 2019"

This is the most expensive dishwasher that I ever bought. Did a lot of research before choosing this one. Never had a Bosch brand of anything but wanted to try one. Glad that I did. Did my own installation and went pretty easy. Note for DIYer's, make sure you measure the length of supply and drain hoses needed. The installation kit's supply line and the drain line I bought was too short. Extra trip to the store. Instructions are good. The brackets supplied for side location really don't work. Top location will work perfectly. Also, Bosch recommends powder or pods, not the year supply of dishwasher liquid that I had on hand. So, after getting some pods, I tested the unit out. I was impressed. Very quiet, can't hear it across the room. Been using the auto function, and everything has came out clean and dry. Like the three racks. One of the features that drove me to this one was the ability to fold down some of the tines for bigger pots. Works great. Use the utensil (3rd) rack more than I thought I would. Either location for silverware cleaned as good as the other. Overall, very impressed.",100,"January 1, 2019"

The Best Dishwasher,"This dishwasher is the best appliance purchase we have made to date. It replaced a worn out appliance. I bought it solely on customer reviews. I found several aesthetically stylish dishwashers,but the reviews on this one sold me. This is so quiet I have to double check that it is running. Easy installation; my husband did it in a jiffy. The top slide out came in very handy , and I wash sponges, spatulas, spoons etc on that rack. Dishes come out sparkling clean and I mean sparkling like new glasses. We have tried every wash cycle and it’s the same. We did take the advice and make sure hot water comes out of the faucets before we start the cycle. 
We have had this dishwasher only a month and so far, so good. This dishwasher is surperb in every way and do not regret our purchase at all. Thanks to everyone that took the time to write legitimate reviews and helped me decide on a dishwasher. Those reviews are an enormous help in making a decision. I’ve owned a minimum of 15 dishwashers in my lifetime, I’m 65, and this is one of the very best in cleaning to a sparkle. Even my old dishes looked brighter and I’m not joking. My yucky looking stainless forks looked so much better. Now if it holds up mechanically I’ll be thrilled.",100,"December 28, 2018"

quiet and high quality,"I had always been told to buy a Bosch dishwasher. My kitchen remodel contractors also said it was the best dishwasher money can buy when they saw it. I bought this model partly for the 3rd rack, which I love. It makes it so much easier to put away silverware. The dishwasher is nice and quiet; the loudest thing about it is when the water drains into the pipe under the sink. 

We have the intensive drying turned on and use rinse aid and plastic is still wet. Might try adding on the extra dry eventually, but it's no big deal. We've tried the Auto and Normal cycles and I do think Auto cleans a little better.

Be sure to install the drain hose with the high loop under your sink. The instruction book says the loop needs to be at least 33"" off the cabinet floor, but my cabinet isn't even 33"" inside. I have it as high as I can. There is still some kind of odor when I open the door, not sure what that is but if something was clogged up apparently it would give me an error code.

I love how the display tells me how much time is left in the cycle and how the machine auto turns off at the end. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]",100,"December 22, 2018"
Best dishwasher I’ve ever had,"I had a Bosch dishwasher in my previous home and loved it, so when I needed a new one I knew it had to be a Bosch. I love how quiet it is! My pots, pans, flatware, glasses and dishes are all cleaner and much drier at the end of the cycle than with the dishwasher I replaced. I use the auto cycle most. The only criticism I have is the length of time for most cycles. I love the third rack for flatware. I don’t ever use the basket so I have room for more on the bottom rack.

Love Our New Cleaning Machine!,"Easy to use, great job in cleaning dishes, has a lot of space and versatile in configuration of dishes, like option of three racks to use, drys dishes well with drying solution, very quite, 2-hr cycle for wash to dry.

Would like the bottom of wire rack for middle rack to be flat instead of the hump in the center.  Makes loading/placing dishes awkward as they tend to tip one way of the other due to the angle of the hump. Minor complaint. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]",100,"December 22, 2018"
