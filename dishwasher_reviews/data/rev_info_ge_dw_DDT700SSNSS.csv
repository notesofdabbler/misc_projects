Piece of Junk,The wheels fell off and melted with the first use! Then the entire piece that holds the wheels in place comes off EVER TIME I pull out the bottom rack!! Wheels fall off every time we use it and now multiple wheels have melted!,20,"September 9, 2020"
Overall excellent,"I have only had the dishwasher running for 4 days.   The dishwasher was straightforward and easy to install.   I had the previous model which lasted 7 years in a house of 5.   Which I can say is actually a long time based on the number of washes.   I have actually decided to replace the failing pump on that model and put it behind the the bar in the basement.  So far I am not disappointed with the replacement being an improved model.   I can see GE has improved on the circuit board, controls and added features from the older model.   I gave it 4 stars only because the evaluation time isn’t there yet but the dishes come out gleaming. I would recommend the washer.",80,"September 1, 2020"
not stainless steel!,"Very sad to state that this ""stainless steel"" started to rotten within a few months after the purchase. This is not stainless steel. My water faucet does not have any problems after 22 yrs of usage, but this dishwasher looks awful. I frequently scrub it w/ a toothbrush & tried different chemicals & natural cleaners, which helps some, but the rusty spots just don't come off. 
The dishwasher also has very long running cleaning cycles, and if I choose a shorter one, then the soap does not come out from the soap compartment.",20,"August 9, 2020"

Original Fill funnel gasket not a good design,"The original fill funnel gasket (located on the left side of the dishwasher where the water comes into the dishwasher from the water hose) is not a good design and came loose on my dishwasher, causing a leak all underneath and ruining my floor. The threads on the funnel gasket part are not deep enough to catch and hold securely, so there is not a good seal and pops off easily, causing it to leak all over. I just ordered a new part, and I see the entire fill funnel gasket kit is a new design. I am glad to see that, and hoping it works better than the original one that used to come with the dishwasher. I am very upset that this poor design has now ruined my kitchen floor and ceiling of the downstairs level of my house. Poor design.",60,"July 29, 2020"

Lower Rack Wheels Fall Off,"Lets try this again.  GE did not like my last review because of my comment about the design of the lower rack wheels.  The lower rack wheels that I have on my new GE Adora appliance are not at all like the design shown in your parts catalog for my model.  There is not cover plate to hold the carriage wheels on.

The utensil sprayers and top extra rack are a nice touch. Only negatives are figuring out where to put the extra rack if not needed and have tall things in top rack, and installation was a little difficult at one point.

I like the several settings available with the different specific applications for different modes and actions to do the wash. Most of the time I don't use the heat dry setting and it even has a dry boost. I also like the water heater boost application. I also prefer the stainless steel tub inside over the white finished ones I've had before. Now, let's talk about how quiet it is..... At first I was concerned whether it was on or not. I had to get used to the fact that it is so quiet. There's a second shallow extra top rack that I use of kitchen knives and spatulas----super flat items only, that works really well. The main dish rack at the bottom has adjustable legs to hold the dishes whether they are large or small. The second row is fixed. And, of course, the main thing is that so far it gets everything clean. I feel good about being able to easily remove the filter at the bottom to rinse off any residue on it and it is easy to just rinse it off and reinstall it. The silverware utensils basket has three separate lids to hold small items in basket if needed. I really like everything about it.",100,"December 10, 2019"

"I want to start this off with a comment about my old dishwasher. When selecting a dishwasher, be...","I want to start this off with a comment about my old dishwasher. When selecting a dishwasher, beware of models with racks that fold up and down and allow you to reconfigure the space. While this sounds like a nice feature and gives you flexibility, what I found with this previous (Maytag) model is where the racks folded up and down became a failure point for the plastic coating on the rack. We didn’t move them up and down often, maybe once a year if that, but the clamp that holds them in place caused excessive wear on the plastic coating, which eventually wore away and rusted. Eventually I used a Dremel to cut away the rusted parts, bought a repair kit to patch up the plastic coating, and used bits of sprinkler wire to lash the remaining racks in place. This bought me several more years of useable live to the rack when otherwise I would have had to replace the unit.
Now as for the new DW. The design avoids the issue mentioned above. The racks slide very easily, so easily it’s surprising. The outer finish has the same issues with fingerprints, etc. that all our stainless-steel appliances do. The unit makes an efficient use of space and we like how the silverware rack is off to the side, opening up the center of the bottom section. 
This unit is also incredibly quiet when running. I’d estimate it makes about 25-30% of the noise our previous DW did. Our kitchen is open to the family room and I was able to watch television with a normal volume level while the dishwasher was running 10 feet behind me. Five Stars on the appliance so far. 
I feel I need to share our installation experience and offer some words of advice. If you’re going to be arranging your own installation, either by yourself or with your own plumber, I’ll leave it to you to follow the instructions provided. If you’re going to be utilizing Home Depot’s services, unless your DW space is immediately adjacent to your sink cabinet, I recommend you take a picture down to the local store and discuss the installation requirements with one of their salespeople. I completed my order online and scheduled the installation online. This was all easy so far. There are installation requirements available, but I found they are not complete. When the installers came the first time, they first checked my shutoff valve, found it had seized, and said it would have to be replaced before they could do the installation. There is nothing in the installation requirements about checking the valve. We offered to shut off the water completely but they said that wouldn’t suffice. The installers left a number for a plumber and said I could call and schedule him to come out to change the valve and complete the installation, and it would all be covered.
When I called the number, the plumber didn’t take my call so I left a message. He responded with a text message that he was not aware of any dishwasher install. I responded explaining the situation and he said they must have given me a wrong number because they don’t do that work. I found out later the installers should have given me the number of their office to schedule the work.
At this point I called my local store and talked to an associate in Appliances and was told that I would have to replace the shut off valve myself, and he gave me the number to call to arrange an installation afterwards. So I arranged for my plumber to replace the valve and scheduled an install at the next available time, about 10 days later.
When the second team of installers came they took one look at my kitchen configuration (see photo) and said because my DW cabinet was not immediately next to my sink cabinet (there is a wedge of open space in between) they were not authorized to do the install. I showed them the first work order with the phone number of the plumber they told me to call and they said the first installers never should have done that but should have put me in touch with dispatch to arrange for a licensed plumber to do it, at Home Depot’s expense. They called their office and I spoke with the scheduler and she confirmed they could arrange for someone to come out and do the work. We set a date/time and the work was eventually completed.
At this point I was fairly upset and visited my local store in person to discuss it. Unfortunately, the associate I spoke with on the phone was unavailable, but I talked with a couple of assistant managers and an appliance specialist. As soon as I described the kitchen layout, the specialist recognized the issue and said unless the DW space is right up against the sink cabinet, the regular installers “won’t touch it”. This was news to the two assistant managers. That’s why I say, it would have paid to talk first to someone at the store who knew about this, although I can’t say for sure it would have come up. The assistant manager did offer to make it right by me and I now have an installed quality appliance.",100,"October 16, 2019"
Nice Dishwasher,I like the looks & features of this Dishwasher & the Quality of GE,100,"October 8, 2019"
Great replacement,"Although replacing existing dishwasher I decided to do a like new install. Replacing both the water-in line, drain hose and the 120 volt cable connecting the old dishwasher. I connected the electrical cord to the new DDT700. Then replaced the switch under the sink with a switched outlet. Running the cord and new hoses was easy as I followed the path of the old ones.
  Applying the plastic trim pieces across the top and down the sides, gave me a bit of a problem. I applied a little liquid dish soap in the trim groove and problem solved. I slid the unit in place, insured it was level and fastened brackets to the underside of the counter top. Next I connected water and drain lines, plugged it in Job completed. 
Pro’s 
Well written Installation instructions are easy to follow and understand. Everything needed for the install is included, with some extra might be needed plumbing items. If connecting to a sink waste disposer, remember to remove the plug inside the disposer inlet. 
This is a very clean looking unit and to use a cliché, fit and finish is excellent. Top of door control with many options is accessible, easy to use and read. Options include, Five wash cycles / Steam sanitize / Dry boost, off, normal and high / Wash temp boost / Wash levels upper, lower and both. 
The digital timer shows approximate time to complete washing based on chosen options, when washing it shows time remaining. Light on the front is amber when washing and turns white when rinsing and drying. Plenty of headroom for tall items. Large removable basket for flatware with spray jets below for better cleaning. Top of cabinet has a sprayer and the bottom and mid cabinet units use revolving spray arms. The middle rack is easy to raise and lower for more clearance above bottom rack or top rack. A third tier (upper level) rack for flatware and cooking utensils looks like it will also be handy. Plenty room for even large cooking Utensils. After six uses I find it does a very good job of cleaning dishes, flatware, cups, tumblers and cookware. Very important, it is unbelievably quiet. 
Con’s (No deal breakers) 
Minimum user manual included, requiring you to access a more complete one online. That said, operation is very intuitive and the controls are easy to use and understand. It uses drain filters as opposed to a self cleaning soft food disposer. This requires  pre-rinsing / scraping some dishes and monitoring the filters to avoid unwanted odors.",100,"September 25, 2019"

The unit has Zone washes which allows you to wash as few or as many dishes as you wish( as long as you don't exceed the racks) . There is a steam option which works pretty well on caked on stuff but if your not careful you can still bake some stubborn stuff on but overall its a nice feature.
The control panel is easy to use and the unit does as advertised. I did not get the installation from Home depot being a DIY guy . I kinda wish I had and suggest you get it as well . I found some of the instructions not quite as comprehensive as they could have been. The interior of the unit comes with a food grinder built in so those food caked dishes will be less likely to clog your plumbing. The middle rack is height adjustable, 2 position, and give plenty of room for glasses and bottles. The top rack is great and has its own zone so you can do a very small quantity of dishes. All in all other than the installation seems to be a very good machine.",100,"September 13, 2019"
"The Adora line is exclusive to Home Depot. It gives the appearance of a premium line, but I found...","The Adora line is exclusive to Home Depot. It gives the appearance of a premium line, but I found too many compromises and poor design choices to justify that. Note that GE Appliances is now a brand owned by the Haier Group of China.

Installation was typical, though I was annoyed by the use of four separate threaded feet rather than a front-access to raise or lower the rear, or adjustable wheels as found on a KitchenAid model I replaced with the GE. The cover for the wiring box would not fit as a plastic fastener on the chassis interfered with it. The insulation mat over the tub is so thin as to be of no effect, and it is missing insulation behind the toekick. If one believes the multi-model installation guide, some of these features do appear on other GE dishwashers. I was also disappointed in the build quality where the tub is welded together. There are ""trim strips"" that are to snap over the edge of this weld, but can't because it is too uneven.

This model has, in current fashion, a shallow top rack for flatware, but there are no dedicated water jets for this. I found that teaspoons slid out from the slots, leaving the bowls facing up to collect water. There is also a more traditional basket on the bottom rack with a dedicated water jet underneath. Unfortunately if you chose to not use the basket, so as to get more room, you can't shut off those jets. Note that this model does NOT have the raised ""bottle jets"" other GE models have.

The upper rack can be adjusted to just two positions. The lower position is so low that the upper water sprayer hits dinner plates in the lower rack. The upper position limits what you can put in, unless you remove the third rack. The prongs on the upper rack aren't tall enough to keep large glasses from tipping over, and those can't be placed along the sides either as they'll fall over there.

The layout of the bottom rack is also problematic. I found that I could not place rimmed glass plates in adjacent slots without them banging into each other. Again, the prongs are too short and there isn't the usual ""kink"" at the bottom that helps hold plates in place.

This is my first top-control dishwasher, and it was annoying that I would keep activating buttons with my shins when the door was down and I was trying to load it. I like that there is a time-remaining display, but you really can't see it when the door is closed. And speaking of the door, the stainless steel finish is a magnet for fingerprints and smudges.

In operation, it is moderately quiet, but not as quiet as the similarly-priced KitchenAid it replaced. It cleaned the dishes fine, and the fine mesh filters don't require cleaning every time. Note that the heating element is exposed in this model. There are quite a few cycle options, and you can disable heated drying (which we always do.) I didn't try the ""steam"" feature.

This model is capable of being ""connected"" to your home WiFi network, enabling use of an app to monitor the cycle, lock controls and automatically order more detergent pods. Unlike some GE models where this feature is built-in, you have to separately purchase the GE ConnectPlus PBX10W00Y0 module, not sold by Home Depot. (I bought it from the GE Appliances web site, where it was cheaper than from other sources.) This plugs in to a connector behind the toekick. I'd love to be able to tell you how it works, but I never got it to finish connecting - it always failed in the ""finishing up"" phase. 

In summary, this is a mid-line dishwasher at best, with some annoying design and build quality issues. I think there are better choices at this price point.",40,"September 8, 2019"

I ordered this GE Adora high tub stainless steel dishwasher because it offered a variety of features at a mid range price point. Although this Adora is not the top of the GE dishwasher line it does offer a third rack and stainless steel tub and even though it is noise rated at 48 dba it is extremely quiet. 

The install and delivery of this dishwasher was flawless, the delivery service had the old one removed and the new one installed in a little over an hour. When they unpacked the dishwasher we noticed the outer insulation was a little thin so we decided to keep the thicker insulation from my old dishwasher hoping it would lessen the vibration noise between the dishwasher and counter top but I have to say this dishwasher is really, really quiet. This Adora dishwasher has a stainless steel print resistant exterior and interior which is quite easy to clean and the stainless interior should keep the inside from rusting . This dishwasher has a tall tub which accommodates 3 racks, 2 very large racks for dishes and a top rack which is really handy for long utensils and cutlery. The second rack is adjustable 2 inches up or down so you can place large items in the bottom rack which is really a nice feature
Also included is a silverware basket with separators. 

Other features that make this dishwasher a good purchase are the multitude of wash features, besides the short, normal and heavy washes it also includes a 1 hour wash. I like this setting because I usually rinse my dishes prior to putting them in the dishwasher and I don't need a two hour wash on my everyday dishes. You also have the ability to wash a half load of dishes- you can wash just the bottom or the middle racks separately - which is great for cleaning small loads and also a real water saver. There is a choice of dry or extra dry at the end of the cycle. Another feature I really like on this dishwasher is there is a separate sprayer under the silverware basket and so far all of my silverware has come out spotlessly clean. 

This is a great dishwasher but there are a few insignificant negatives. The actual racks are not that substantial at least compared to my previous dishwasher and there is no glassware guards on the middle rack so there is nothing to hold your stemware in place. I noticed the dishwasher display is always on unless you close the door until you hear the click, then the digital display turns off when not in use. On the handle there is some decorative chrome trim on the bar and around the display and it shows water spots/water stains (the manufacturer should consider removing the chrome trims trim in my opinion). Last, there are no instructions included related to its operation, (install instructions are included). I would assume they want you to go online for these but I prefer a hard copy

Overall the GE Adora tall tub dishwasher is a very nice quality dishwasher. It is extremely quiet, does a excellent job of cleaning glassware and dishes and offers a wide variety of wash and dry cycles with half load and 1 hour wash cycles. For a mid-range dishwasher this is a good option, it has a stainless steel tub, 3 racks, with many wash options and all available at a great price (especially if you get it on sale)!

First, it has a cavernous interior and seems to be able to fit more than others. The top tray for cutleries is particularly useful. The bottom tray can be also re-arrange, which is nice. I also like that the menu is easy to navigate. The one hour clean is indeed one hour and that's very convenient. The dishwasher does look nice with a sober front and is easy to clean. Unlike other top-control dishwashers, it is actually possible with this one to read the time left without having to open the door. Dishes do come clean. Finally, it is rated 270 kwh/year which is really good. 

It is not perfect though. First, dishes come out wet, even with using rinsing agent. The heating element is not protected - unlike many modern dishwashers - and is sitting at the bottom of the dishwasher: if one plastic container falls, it will melt. The dishwasher is certainly not loud, especially compared to a twenty years old dishwasher. However, compared to similar price-range models, it is definitively louder then some of them. Unlike some competitors with which it is hard to know whether they are on or not, this one seems to have much less noise insulation. None of those items are no-nos for me and there are quick remedies for all of them: I open the door before going to bed and the dishes are dried in the morning. The noise ievel is also acceptable (completely fine to have a conversation.)",100,"September 5, 2019"

The dishwasher is so quiet I had to lean in to be sure it was actually on. Adjustable racks that will accommodate tall items and larger items. You can even wash a half-load in either the upper or lower rack without sacrificing cycles with options available on a full wash. There is also a third rack across the top of the dishwasher to easily clean an entire flatware collection, knives and small utensils. There are forty jets just for silverware, so you get a spotless cleaning. No pre-rinsing of normal food soil is required. Use automatic dishwashing detergent in the detergent dispenser. Also add a rinse agent to the rinse dispenser. The user instructions are very clear. My favorite things are the smooth front and Dry Boost with Fan Assist.

It's a top control stainless steel dishwasher from GE. It looks great, runs quiet, and has an extra drawer on top for flatware (like grilling/baking utensils).

The installation instructions are fairly thorough, but I would recommend getting it professionally installed. Dishwashers that aren't installed correctly can have draining problems, might not clean dishes very well, and could make more noise than they should.

That being said, this dishwasher cleans dishes very well, and seems to have a setting/function for every load. You can't expect a dishwasher to get really baked on filthy dishes spotlessly clean. However when we load the dishwasher right after cooking/eating a meal everything has come out clean for us. Just choose the right washing options, and clean dishes as soon as you soil them, and you shouldn't have any problems.

This dishwasher has a ton of capacity. I particularly like the extra thin drawer on top for flatware, or a extra couple plates. More capacity in the dishwasher means less dirty dishes that have to sit in the sink waiting for the next load.

This dishwasher looks great. Having the controls on the top really cleans up the look, and if you have this dishwasher installed correctly it makes almost no noise when it's running. Finally the option to wash lightly soiled dishes in roughly an hour including dry time is fantastic.


We ordered this dishwasher online, it arrived on time, was package well, and was not damaged at all in shipping. The delivery company was very professional and helpful.

I believe this dishwasher is a great value; It's a good name brand, it looks great, and it works quietly and does a great job. When we ordered this dishwasher, it was on special at almost 30% off the original list price.",100,"August 28, 2019"

Super Quiet!,"I bought this dishwasher after looking at many different brands and models. I was already sold on the features it had (i.e. third rack, two washing zones, etc.) but I was a little concerned about how loud the dishwasher would be. I've only had this appliance for about two weeks but I can say that I love it. It is so quiet! I can run a full load before going to bed and not hear a sound. I can run a load while watching tv and I can barely hear it. Aside from that, it washes everything perfectly. I love the steam option on the unit as well.",100,"July 13, 2018"
Nice details,"I installed the unit myself. There were a few extra steps such as the sound dampening and the rubber trim molding that made the installation a lot more complete and professional. It looks great, it's very quiet, end of the third rack at the top is a nice extra. Looking forward to many years of use.",100,"June 19, 2018"
Great dishwasher!!! A couple small flaws.,I bought this dishwasher about a year ago and I love it! There are a couple of things that need a little bit of work though. All the cycles take a long time to go through! It would be nice to have a quick wash under an hour once in a while.  Also the top metal trim piece on the front door caught on a piece of clothing and snapped in half after only a week of having it. Trying to get it replacement part has been very difficult.,80,"May 5, 2018"

The Adora fits in so the front is flush with my cabinet adding to that polished look to compliment a kitchen. I love the logo on the door!  Very elegant. The Adora is very quiet.

Installation was a pain. The instructions are absolute garbage. They should be embarrassed to have printed them.
The Kitchen Aid we installed 12 years earlier went in pretty easily. There was a lot of fidgeting around trying to get this in and set right. The clips that hold it to the sides are not very well designed at all and it was difficult to get the screws lined up with them.
When we first installed it, it didn't dry well and made a lot of noise. We called and a technician came out and said that the fan wasn't aligned and that it was a pretty common problem. Fixed in 30 minutes.
It does clean dishes well. No complaints there.
The 3rd drawer at the top is nice to clean long handled utensils and not have them take up other space in the lower baskets.
It's kind of noisy. Not super loud, but I'd expected a new dishwasher to be at least as quiet as the 12 year old one it replaced.
When I pull the lower drawer out, it doesn't move smoothly. It's like the base and the door aren't quite aligned.

First, the rolling bottom rack has very cheap poor wheels. You must pull it directly from the center front of the rack, which is not the natural way to pull it out,  or it easily falls off the track and misaligns constantly. 
The door has a rattle in it, which we were told by after having a GE tech coming out that that is the way it is meant to be. It is vent in the door that bags and hits the door as you open and lower it. Very annoying and poor design. This is not a cheap dishwasher and should not have a banging with it that comes standard.

Poorly Designed Racking System,"I didn't plan to write this review. I was actually looking for accessories for this unit hoping to alleviate my buyers remorse. This dishwasher cleans incredibly but has many design flaws. My previous GE Profile machine allowed me to reconfigure the bottom rack to accommodate a variety of sized dishes. This does not. It does hold pots, plates, and large bowls nicely but there is no place to put small to mid sized dishes which most people use daily. The adjustable upper rack  is very nice but unfortunately does not keep glasses upright nor are the rows efficiently spaced.  Finding places to put our dishes each day has become a real challenge.  We are very disappointed in the overall design of this dishwasher.",60,"October 13, 2020"
Dont Get This Model,This model needs a new design for the loading racks. This model breaks drinking glasses because the racks don't hold cups and glasses properly.

IT'S A DISH BREAKER,I love the way this DW looks.  It is sleek and matches the rest of my GE appliances.  The racks in this dishwasher are absolutely horrible!  The top rack is too big to hold any glasses securely.  They are always moving around and breaking.  The bottom rack has these weird rubber strips that hold up the prongs where the plates go.  The strips slip and the prongs collapse under the weight of the plates.  I have lost many plates this way because they break.  I am hoping that GE will have some sort of recall and replace the bottom rack with something sturdier and better.  Our old GE racks were much better.  I do like the pull out utensil rack at the top of the dishwasher and for that it would earn one star.,20,"October 2, 2020"

Racks are very poorly designed.,"I have had the GE Adora for about a month, and have found that packing the dishwasher is problematic. The second rack allows the dishes to slide around, and as a result several glasses have been broken in the washing process. I have never had this problem with other dishwashers. Also the bottom rack tines are too far apart. Plates and bowls can be packed on this rack, but there is a large space between the two rows that has no tines to hold the dishes. This is great for very large items, but is problematic for smaller items such as additional plates or bowls. I really like the 3rd rack and the layout of the silverware  rack. The dishwasher seems to wash well, but does not completely dry the dishes on the Norrmal Dry Boost, so they are often damp as the end of the cycle.",60,"August 30, 2020"

After having sent two different teams (5 guys who spent over 4 hours in our house during the pandemic) they left taking all the install I needed to really install the unit. I had to buy the items from GE parts. Had to buy it because these people are delivery people and know nothing about dishwasher installations. They couldn't even figure out how to remove the old unit (2 screws for heavens sake) - I had to find the screws and show them. They didn't even connect the unit to the counter or cabinets. When I opened the door after they had left the entire unit slid out of counter. I ripped it all out and redid everything they had done as it was all total crap. Backwards water connection etc. Run don't walk away from Home Depot's dishwasher installation services. Was just lost wasted money along with hours of my time and additional cost. I could have bought the most expensive dishwasher for what it cost me to redo and pay them to do nothing. Was a loyal Home Depot customer for over 20 years.

Top shelf items are difficult to stabilize while opening and closing drawer.  3rd rack diminishes capacity of upper shelf.  VERY POOR design for filling the gaps between the counter and DW.  They send three plastic strips that are not made 'square' and will not attach correctly to the DW- one end of the strip goes on while the end rises. It's a really cheap idea for the cost of the DW.  We threw ours out.  Operating buttons can be touchy- sometimes need multiple press to get it started while other times an accidental brush will activate it.  We purchased this DW as part of a package.  I would purchase the other products again and love them, but I would not purchase this DW again.",40,"August 22, 2020"
Would not purchase again,"We purchased this as part of a package. We didn’t really need a new DW but wanted matching stainless appliances- changed from classic white after 20 years.  I expected to see a huge difference since it was new- not really.  I do like the large bottom drawer capacity and targeted silverware area- but even small amounts of  peanut butter still won’t wash off.  The dishes are difficult to stabilize on the top rack when opening and closing.  I looked forward to the 3rd rack but it limits the height of the second drawer.  I would remain with 2 if I ordered again.  The buttons are a little touchy- sometimes press multiple times to activate while others an accidental bump sets it off.  Overall, the DW is ok if your goal is to save money with a package purchase.",40,"August 22, 2020"

*No insulation on the fill valve - very noisy.  I had to add it
*No wheels on the rear to facilitate installation.  Has standard feet instead and took extra time to install.

Bottom rack is frustrating,"Overall this is a good dishwasher.  It's quiet, the dishes get clean, I love the top flat rack.  The only problem I have is the lower rack.

They are constantly falling into the bottom of the dishwasher and melting because of the heating element.  There is no way to get them to stay on so that the whole bottom rack doesn't fall off when you are loading or moving it!

I gave it 3 stars because it does clean well and dishes are dry at the end of the cycle which is an improvement over our last dishwasher. On the downside the racks are very cheap, the tub capacity is much smaller than our previous Whirlpool dishwasher, and the wash cycle is a crazy 3 HOURS long on the regular setting.",60,"July 30, 2020"

Had it for 3 months all the bottom rack wheels fell off and melted,"I had my last dishwasher for over 10 years, so when it finally broke down we came to Home Deopt in search of a new one. The older man who helped us said that for the money the GE Adora series was wonderful. It ran quiet had 3 racks and was a great little number for the money. So after doing some research we went for it. We purchased on April 8, 2020 and got within 2 weeks ( mostly due to covid which wasn't an issue). We got the old one out, put the new one in with little to no issues at all. After about 5-8 loads I tried to pull the bottom rack out which seemed to become harder and harder to do, it would pull off track etc. Well come to find out 2 of the wheels had popped off and had gone behind the filter, so we couldn't see them, they were melted so rendered unusable. It is now July 18, 2020 and I have exactly 1 wheel left, the rest have all popped off and are making the bottom rack a nightmare to pull out and push back in. We have placed calls to GE, only no one seems to answer, I have emailed but nothing. Paying over $800 for something that is going to have issues right out of the gate really makes me angry. We work hard for our money and expect that when we purchase a large appliance it should at least work and not have any issues only weeks into getting it. If you are looking for a dishwasher that wont have issues and a company that will actually answer you when you do, pass this one up.",60,"July 18, 2020"

Installation is a PAIN,"Okay I have installed 50 dishwashers in my time and this is by far the most difficult install I have ever dealt with! Lets start with the leg screws, back legs do not have threaded hole to screw into. So when screwed in they sit in a cross thread uneven fashion. Also the legs are very rounded so to adjust using a crescent wrench, forget about it! Oh and you will need a partner or four. Drain hose is three feet long so I hope your dishwasher is close otherwise forget it. Electrical box cover is a pain. You have to slide it over the electrical piece and then get the extruding metal piece to sit in its place which requires you to smash the fragile electrical piece over. To top it off the screw supplied is to big for the hole (be prepared so are all the other screw holes). Best of all the screw to secure the washer in place is so short and has a flat tip to start the screw WHAT WERE THEY THINKING!!!!! Stop making crap, focus on one design and perfect it cause honestly its getting worse every new model.
There are so many things I can say about this dish washer. I just pray that the day after the warranty expires this doesn't break. I swear they make them this way. Oh and it took 6 weeks to show up NICE.",20,"July 8, 2020"

First Impressions are Good,"Deciding on an appliance is really hard so here are the reasons we went with this model of all units in the price range and first impressions. It was stainless steel (though not fingerprint resistant) and had the look we wanted, had the third rack which has come in handy in our old dishwasher and frees up space. Some tines on the bottom rack in the back are able to fold down to fit larger pots and pans. There are jets under the silverware that help get that clean. Finally, it was in stock and could be delivered in 3 weeks, which was not true of many models during COVID. The negatives were that its plastic(standard for the price range), the racks don't slide very easily, and a lot of reviews have mentioned issues with rollers falling off the bottom. It also can take over 3 hours with dry boost and sanitizing settings, which is a long time. It is also not fingerprint resistant and I think that will come to be annoying.  Upon the first wash, the dishes were very clean and mostly dry with just a few drops of water on a few dishes. The point of the dishwasher is to clean the dishes, so I'm glad that's the best feature. Overall we are impressed for the price and hope that it continues to perform well.",80,"June 22, 2020"

Terrible experience.,"I purchased this dishwasher from Home Depot in early April. When we got it home and installed, the dishwasher itself was broken. The wheels kept falling off the lower rack and melting in the bottom. It took over 2 MONTHS, multiple service calls, and HOURS on the phone with GE, to get them to fix the problem. The issue? They put the wrong wheel housings on my dishwasher. Simple plastic parts, but it took them forever to respond and send the correct parts. I will NEVER buy from GE again. Product Quality is far from acceptable.

Worst Dishwasher I’ve owned.,The bottom rack falls off track all the time and top rack never drys,20,"May 18, 2020"
"Great performance, installation could be better","Works great. Fits a lot of dishes. Two problems: in installation it should include the 3/4"" adapter for their inlet. That's a small part that should be included. I don't like the way the solenoid is attached to that plastic adapter, in case you need to replace it. If the 3/4"" threaded adapter was included this wouldn't be a problem. Next the drain pipe has an air valve on the side which rotates and if it's angled to the side that machine leaks like crazy. You have to make sure that side air junction is facing up at all times. Seems kind like a goofy design. It got moved when we installed the machine and leaked at first, but we quickly fixed the issue. Other than those things the unit is great.

JUNK!  No wonder this model is no longer offered,"JUNK!!! I bought the GE Adora series when I remodeled my condo three years ago.  I rent to a single adult who travels about two weeks a month, and I have been told by a GE Serviceperson that the motherboard is blown, and will have to pay 550+ for repair.",20,"April 27, 2020"
Good with a few minor irritants,"Overall great dishwasher
LOVE the third rack, I will never wash breast pump parts by hand ever again!
A few things I would change if I could
-the touchpad controls on the top, I hit them with my pants/legs constantly when I am loading the dishwasher
-The dishes are always wet.  To get them mostly dry (but still wetter than my old/dishwasher), you have to do the high boost dry cycle
-The shortest cycle is 60 min but that's with no drying.  The standard cycle is 2 hours.  The normal cycle with dry boost is 4 hours.  Just means I had to adjust how I do my dishes, mostly run only at night
-i wish you could do a dry cycle only (but only because the dishes are so wet)",80,"April 26, 2020"

Wheels fall off,"We just purchased this and I love it so far, except the wheels fall off of the bottom rack when it's full and you're pulling it out to unload. It's happened every time so far. They're plastic and will melt if they hit the heating element at the bottom. Bad design for sure!

very quiet,very satisfied with this purchase.  dishes come out spotless and the machine is very quiet.,100,"April 23, 2020"
cheap parts,Overall the dishwasher has nice features and works fine. My only complaint is how cheap the bottom rack is. The wheels are cheap plastic that pop off almost every time I pull the bottom rack in or out. You have to push the rack from the very middle otherwise it will be pushed off the tracks and the wheels pop off. Extremely frustrating and disappointing that a $1000 dishwasher is made with such cheap finishes,40,"April 22, 2020"

"Complete dishwasher, more than we expected","Many cycle selections and very, very quiet. We have had this for 6 months and love it, but it took some learning. We use the heavy cycle more often as it may be longer but uses less water. I can pack more into this than our previous one. The silverware holder it awesome (finally a manufacture to get it correct; forks/spoones upright, knives facing down). It works best with finish, but don't use cheap detergent. The top pull out tray is a great feature, usable for spatula and big knives. It's also much deeper in hight able to fit my large glass skillet cover easily. Out of all my stainless steel appliances, this is the hardest to keep clean. I found that baby shampoo/water mix and microfiber cloth works best.",100,"April 20, 2020"

I've only been using it for a few days now, but it cleans and dries perfectly. The only thing I would have done differently would be to purchase the one that was fingerprint resistant. It wasn't going to be in stock for a while, so I was impatient. I believe that would be worth the wait. But other than that, it is a great dishwasher.",100,"April 18, 2020"

Our previous dishwasher was super noisy and our kitchen is adjacent to our living room so if it was running you couldn't hear anything. This however you can barely tell it's on.

Ultimately I decided on this one and it's been an amazing purchase. It tackles everything we've thrown at it, smiled and kept on truckin. The third rack and the ability to move the middle rack up and down has been amazing. I've found that we can fit so many more dishes in it and they all come out clean and spotless.

Does it's job well!  Not perfect though.,"We really like how well this dishwasher cleans everything.  In fact, we have only two complaints, and one of those might be more of a personal preference issue.  

Things we love:
1) The top silverware drawer is nice if we ever have a ton of silverware when family is in town or something.  It can also be removed if you don't really use it.
2) The upper drawer is deep, allowing for tall glasses to go in there with little effort, especially if the silverware drawer is removed.  The ability to adjust it up and down is awesome.  We don't use the feature frequently, but it's nice to be able to sacrifice some space at the top to allow for bigger items below.  
3)  This thing is crazy quiet.  Like, my wife had to lean over and listen when she heard it running the first time.  This is nice because we no longer have to use the timer because we just turn it on when it's full.  Also, it's nice because you can tell when something is interfering with the water spinner because you can hear it smacking the dish because it is otherwise so quiet.
4) Seems to do a great job cleaning the dishes.
5) The status light on the front is really helpful on such a quiet machine.

Issues:
1) The spacing in the top drawer is a little wider than what we're used to.  We had to rearrange how we put everything in there, and after about 1 1/2 months, we're still working on how to best arrange our kids dishes in there.  Seems minor, I know, and I think we'll get it dialed in after a couple more months.  At the very least, it won't be a concern once the kids are older.
2)  It would be nice to have an intermediate option when it comes to adjusting the upper drawer's height.  Sometimes you need to fit big things on the top and bottom!
3)  We've had it for a short time, and the dryer has stopped working.  At first, I thought we turned the heated dryer function off, but this seems to be something different.  Hopefully we can get whatever it is fixed under warranty.",80,"March 21, 2020"

First, we paid for the installation and install kit. The guys who delivered it and were supposed to install it walked in, saw that our dishwasher is not right next to the sink and said ""We can't install it"" even though I told them the water supply line is a permanent line that is already there and the drain line is already there, they just said they couldn't and just left. So I called and complained and got the installation fee and kit fee refunded. Then it took over a week to get a plumber in to install it. That's the way it goes and obviously I do not blame Home Depot or GE for that but, after it was installed, it doesn't work. It pumped water into the dishwasher, never ran a cycle and won't pump out the water in the bottom of the tub. When you turn it on now, it hums for about a minute then shuts off. No error code or anything. I am having Home Depot take it back. It's a piece of junk and I wouldn;t buy another. We bought it because it is an Adora like our stove, also bought at Home Depot.

Wouldn't pump the water out the first time I turned it on.,"Got it delivered on a Wednesday. I installed it on Thursday. When we opened the box and open the unit it had water and moisture in it which should of been our first sign of an issue. When I turned it on to run a cleaning/ sanitize run through it, it started up making a sound like it was working. I had to work that night so later in the evening my wife connected me and told me the water hadn't drained from the dishwasher and it had standing water inside. I asked her to call Home Depot and tell them we wanted to return it under their 48 return window. We were advised the unit would be picked up the next Tuesday as Monday was a holiday. On Sunday I decided to disconnect it and remove it from the house to be picked up. I thought I would give it another chance to work. I turned it on and it pumped the water out of the bottom. I thought cool maybe it started working. I turned the same cycle on and the water started filling the dishwasher then stopped. I tried stopping the cycle and restarting it which the instructions said would stop the cycle and pump the water out and then turn off. It didn't pump the water out or would it start up again. I even tried cycling the power to it thinking maybe it would reset itself. Junk from the start. We will be buying a Bosch after our money is returned. The Home Depot people were very helpful with the return process.",20,"February 20, 2020"

Basket tines over time broke off and price to replace baskets were astronomical everywhere online so I searched for a new dishwasher. I've had Bosch, Miele, and GE. I compared KitchenAid, GE, and Bosch, and felt this GE Adora would be just as good as the last one....The Adora series is like Profile Series...top rung of GE...Ordered it online with a great savings of $300 (reduced from $919.00) and free delivery...ordered it on January 10 and delivered on January 15. I scheduled my Master plumber (I only use a specific plumber since he gets it right the first time ALWAYS) for installation today January 21. The dishwasher leaked from 3 spots and none were due to installation or damage during shipping. The pump on the side of the unit had slow leak, the white sleeve and the entire front door gasket area leaked and more severely near the bottom of the door...We could not even let it finish its cycle due to the leakage. We pulled it out slightly to ascertain where it leaked from....definitely factory defects...what a disappointment after my last GE lasted over 6 years...called GE today...I pray for divine intervention that the tech they send out on the 29th will know what the heck he's doing....would love for it to be taken away...will post results of that visit...too late to switch to KitchenAid or Bosch...Not even 1 wash cycle and it's in need of service...what company does this?",20,"January 21, 2020"

Very Happy With This Dishwasher,"Overall this seems like a great dishwasher.  We bought it 3 weeks ago and had Home Depot deliver/install it.  Our area uses a local, licensed plumber to install and it was a really good experience.  The dishwasher is nice looking, but more importantly it does a great job washing dishes.  We had a builder grade dishwasher before this one and the difference is night and day.  You can barely hear this washer when it's on and the dishes come out looking better than ever.  The only reason I didn't give it 5 stars is that the stainless steel really shows fingerprints and smudges pretty bad.  For this price point I think a fingerprint resistant finish is appropriate.  Otherwise I'd definitely buy this again or recommend it to someone in the market for a new dishwasher.",80,"January 12, 2020"

And this thing is REALLY quiet. It's close to our living room (townhouse with open plan) and you can't hear it at all when watching TV.

Twice there was an awful noise while washing and sounded like dishes were hitting together.  Opened it several times to see what it could possibly be.? Appears the lower tray has some dishes closer than others (not equally distributed)  If we do every other slot it appears fine, but than not getting full use and makes for smaller loads.  Very annoying.  Cleaned and dried well, but that clanking noise..........",60,"December 27, 2019"

The rack design is bad with no fold downs on the top rack is bad . The racks are smaller in length than are old dishwashers causing less space. The main problem with this one is the time to wash and dry in normal mode. It starts at 123 min. then goes up from there.

Top dishwasher,"This is the best dishwasher I have ever owned. Extremely quite and I was surprised to find it cleans pots and pans like they were new, no more cleaning before putting them in the washer.",100,"September 19, 2019"
Junk - Control board went out after 4 years,Control board needed to be replaced after 4 years and the repair costs nearly as much as a new product.  I won't ever buy another GE appliance.,20,"September 18, 2019"
good price,After our purchase and installation by a plumber we had issues with draining.  Called for service fixed the problem (caused by the plumber) and now everything is fine.,100,"September 18, 2019"
Very quiet...,I was pleasantly surprised by how quite this machine is. You only know it’s turned on by the light on the dishwasher. This is a great machine!,100,"September 17, 2019"
Upgraded features,The Adora dishwasher offers much greater options and features at greater efficiency. The dishwasher sanitizes dishes and is quieter than the base model it replaced.,100,"September 17, 2019"
Very quite,Love how quite it is.   We have a open concept house.  Can watch tv while dishwasher running.  You hear only when water is filling.  Plays nice tune when finished.  Has 3rd row seating for silverware.  Spacious bottom rack for pots.  Cool hidden buttons with different timed washes and delayed starts.  Stainless steel interior.  It's the Cadillac of dishwashers.,100,"September 14, 2019"
Prepare for an Adventure,"I purchased this and some other GE appliances from Home Depot. The first thing to know is that if there is an issue with any appliance purchased from Home Depot, they have nothing to do with resolving the issue. You are on your own. This particular aplliance came with a defective drain hose. It will be 2 weeks before i receive a replacement from GE. The only customer service worse than Home Depot is GE. I ordered all new appliances from Home Depot and so far all of them have had issues that require me to contact GE as Home Depot insists they have nothing to do with the products they sell.",20,"September 12, 2019"
Keeping it Clean,Seems to be working like a charm. from the moment we start the dishwasher till the end it is quiet and smooth running. The dishes come out clean and the silverware is on its own little rack and when picking them up to put away no one has to touch the part of the utensil that we will be eating off of.,60,"September 11, 2019"
Super quiet,"Works great, love the fold down tines of the basket. 3rd rack a great idea. Very impressed at how quiet it is.",100,"September 11, 2019"
Great dishwasher for the price,"If this model had a fold-down section in the upper rack and the third rack was a uniform depth, we would give this five stars. It is so quiet I almost forget it's running!",80,"September 10, 2019"
great D/W,this is the quietest D/W I've ever had. Some times I go over and make sure it's running - it's so quiet. I use the top third rack for silverware and then i can fit lots more dishes in lower racks.,100,"September 10, 2019"
Nice!,Love the black stainless color and cleaning options.,100,"September 10, 2019"
Very Quiet,"This machine is so quiet, I have to walk up to eat and lean down to see if it is running!  The dishes are cleaned properly and as long as I use the rinse agent, they come out dry.  My only objection is that I can't see to figure out how to use the 3 second button to shut off the washer.  I'll figure it out eventually and it goes off automatically in a short time.",80,"September 10, 2019"
So Quiet I didn't think it was running!,Lovely thing.  It holds a lot more than the old one and it runs so quietly!  I didn't think it was running as there was no noise and no vibration.,100,"September 10, 2019"
Perfect size,"Great appliance looks great, works great. Very quiet",100,"September 10, 2019"
Quiet and Excellent Performance,Great dishwasher for jobs big and small. Runs quieter than any dishwasher I’ve owned. We are loving it.,100,"September 10, 2019"
Not great.,"After a cycle, there is still condensation inside and the dishes are still wet.",60,"September 10, 2019"
Better than Average,"Cleans nicely.  No off button is confusing.  Always seems to be on.
Racks seem a little flimsy and do not open and close smoothly.",80,"September 8, 2019"
Looks and operates great,This dishwasher looks and works great. I love the third rack. Everything cleans and dries perfectly. The only challenges I experienced were the extra insulation that you have to install at the toe kick is a little tricky and installing the gaskets was hard because they didn’t clip on easily. But it is a super quiet and efficient unit. I am happy with my purchase and will be getting other GE appliances when it is time.,100,"September 5, 2019"
better than the last three dishwashers I've had,Great value (props to Home Depot!) and remarkably quiet.,100,"September 4, 2019"

"Quiet, clean wash",Very happy with GE Adora dishwasher. Quiet running and dishes are clean and dry when wash cycle is complete. Options to how you can load the dishwasher is handy.,100,"September 4, 2019"
"Greaat Features, Great Price, Great Cleaning","This is a great dishwasher.  We replaced a much more expensive dishwasher with this one and are very pleased with it so far.  This dishwasher cleans very well, has many cycle options, is very quiet, and looks great.  I would definately buy this dishwaher again.",100,"September 3, 2019"
Love it,This dishwasher is the most quiet I have ever owned.  It does a great job.  I'm sorry they aren't making it anymore.  I got mine at a Sear's Outlet.  It had a small dent that you can hardly see.,80,"September 3, 2019"
Great unit overall.,"This dishwasher does a great job of cleaning, and does it very quietly. The only real issue is that it is difficult to level.",80,"September 3, 2019"
My old dishwasher dries better!,"Don't get me wrong, I like the bells and whistles of this dishwasher. When it comes down to sanitizing and drying dishes, my old dishwasher that I replaced is hands down better!",60,"September 3, 2019"
Great features!,"Love the little shelf at the top, just needs a little help when it comes to small bowls. Really no place to put those in between size bowls so they don’t in up right side up and full of water when the cycle is done!",100,"September 3, 2019"
This is the most expensive piece of junk I ever bought. Electric panel failed exactly after the o...,"This is the most expensive piece of junk I ever bought. Electric panel failed exactly after the one year mark of the warranty. Called GE: $300-$400 to fix. Also, strangely, this model in all home improvement stores was $399. Suddenly, in 2017, it went up a 200% markup, then in 2018 another 150% mark-up. No changes to the model, just price. Don't buy this overpriced junk!",20,"September 2, 2019"
Quietest dishwasher ever,Cleans well and very quiet !!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!,100,"August 28, 2019"
Cleans very good.,We are happy with the GE dishwasher because it does everything well.,100,"August 28, 2019"
"Quite, Great Adjustable Shelves, Ideal Sharp Knife",I easily installed the system. It has done an excellent job washing the dishes.,100,"August 28, 2019"
Love all the features,One of the features on the dishwasher is heat control therefore I can set where it even dries plastic!!,100,"August 28, 2019"
Love the top rack,"I like this appliance. I wish it cleaned better, got the crumbs off, etc. It also doesn’t dry as much as I would like it too",60,"August 27, 2019"
Will not dry the dishes,Disappointed that I buy a new dishwasher and it will not dry the dishes.,60,"August 27, 2019"
Dishwasher,"So happy with my new dishwasher, love the stainless interior and it is so quiet",100,"August 21, 2019"
So spacious - love this diswasher,This dishwasher holds so much and performance is great!,100,"August 21, 2019"
Quiet Dishwasher,"This dishwasher is very quiet which we love. The look of the washer is also nice.
However, I am not a fan yet due to the door of the washer being very hard to shut. If you don't slam it shut, you think you started the washer and then find out it did not start due to the door. Another negative is the inside seems cheap - plastic. The utensil holder is terrible. It is in three removable sections that do not sit right in the washer.",60,"August 21, 2019"
Great value,So far very pleased. All the features we were looking for.,100,"August 20, 2019"
Terrible Dishmachine!,"Doesn't clean - every load has dirty dishes when finished.  And, everything is wet, even when using the drying feature and rinseaid.  VERY disappointed!",20,"August 20, 2019"
Great dishwasher!,Love this dishwasher. Drying cycle not perfect but could be my fault as not setting up right.,80,"August 20, 2019"
Quiet!!,Have only run the dishwasher through one cycle so far.  Very quiet.  Don't know why the inside of the dishwasher is still wet after it is done.,80,"August 8, 2019"
Not what i expected,I replaced an older dishwasher . expected great results but a little disappointed. Awkward to load and still leaves some residue,60,"August 7, 2019"

Great dishwasher,Cleans very well. Very quiet . Streamlined and good looking.,100,"July 30, 2019"
Clean dishes,Dishes come out clean.  Silverwear top drawer saves space for dishes. My wife has difficulties with the undercabinet buttons.,80,"July 30, 2019"
Can barely hear it running!,This is the best dishwasher ever. I love everything about it!,100,"July 30, 2019"
So quite,The first time I ran the dishwasher I thought I forgot to turn it on it was so quite.  What a difference from this one to the old dishwasher.  The old one sounded like a semi truck was going through my townhouse.  Not only is it quiet but everything comes out sparkling.  I'm glad I went with this model.,100,"July 30, 2019"
Love my GE dishwasher,"Absolutely love my new GE dishwasher! It’s quiet, it dries my cups and silverware to 98%, unless a cup has a concave bottom which allows some water to pool in it. I don’t have to dry the insides to put them away. It has the third rack for extra silver ware or lids, which I think is a great added feature. I think you can’t go wrong for the price.",100,"July 29, 2019"
Water inlet valve failed just over one year after,Water inlet valve failure just after one year of operation.,100,"July 21, 2019"
So quiet - is it actually on?,"We bought the GE Adora primarily for the upper (3rd) rack for flat items and silverware. Something the other manufacturers at this price point didn’t offer. While we like the upper rack is great, we are absolutely impressed by how quiet it is.  Well done job GE.",100,"July 21, 2019"
So Quiet!,"The GE Adora dishwasher is so quiet! The tines are spaced adequately to accommodate large dinner plates and bowls, and the heat cycle actually dries the glasses completely. We are so happy.",100,"July 16, 2019"
Great features,We love our dishwasher you can’t even hear it running!,100,"July 16, 2019"
Great Features,"So far, I really like the dishwasher.  It is really quiet and the dishes came out dry.  Hope that it continues to be this great.",100,"July 11, 2019"
Great features,Nice machine so far but we just installed it today,100,"July 5, 2019"
"Super Quiet, Not user friendly","Loved it at first until we put in our 12” dinner plates....The water spinner hits the top of the plates during washing....so now we have an expensive quiet dishwasher that we have to hand wash our dinner plates.  Never had that problem at our old house with a more expensive type model. This has a third rack up top...so whoever designed it, didn’t think about normal living.",60,"July 5, 2019"
Great d/w,"We recently purchased this d/w from Home Depot and like it very much. It is very quiet and I love the third rack. Having a third rack has made me re-think how to load the dishwasher, but over time I'm getting better at filling it to capacity. The cycles are longer than I would like, but the dishes come out clean and overall I'm very pleased.",100,"July 5, 2019"
Love my dishwasher!,This is my second GE dishwasher. I loved my first and there was nothing wrong just wanted to upgrade to the newer model. This is a great dishwasher and very quiet!,100,"July 2, 2019"
Love the GE dishwasher.,Awesome. Can barely hear it! The stainless steel has a great look.,100,"July 2, 2019"
Besutiful design,"We had our washer for very long however there are a few new features compared to our old dishwasher that I really like. First,  there is a third rack for utensils (although it doesn't allow enough clearance for spatulas.) I also really like that you don't have to run the top and the bottom together. The dishwasher has a mode to run just the top rack or just the bottom rack.  Lastly you can set a timer foot the washer to run while you are away.  This machine is also way quieter than my last one which is a higher plus!",80,"June 27, 2019"
Doesn't Dry contents very well,"Even with the Dry heat selected, I have to towel dry every dish and utensil after the cycle is complete.  The top piece where you turn the unit on is coming off on the left side. Now I have to figure out how to get that piece fixed.",20,"June 26, 2019"
Looks great,It cleans ok. Dosent always dry all the way.   But looks good,60,"June 26, 2019"
"Quiet, cleans dishes beautifully","The dishwasher cleans quietly and has loads of interior space with the three pull out racks. Would definitely recommend this model.

Note: we had a rough beginning and had issues with this model originally., but the company was fantastic regarding repairs/replacement.",100,"June 26, 2019"
Quiet and quality dishwasher,"As my title started, this is a quiet and quality dishwasher.  My parents have used a similar model for a little while now, and I liked it. I picked up the updated model, and so far, so good.

Installation was pretty easy. I have a very uneven floor, but it was still pretty easy to get the machine leveled. The only issue I had was with the power cord (that the appliance deliverers provided): the leads were extremely short and it was difficult to connect things up. After the install, I left the bottom plate off to ensure there were no leaks and attached the panel after the first two washes.",100,"June 24, 2019"
Works great,"This dishwasher does exactly what it supposed to do, cleans the dishes sparkling clean. I love it.",100,"June 24, 2019"
the dishes are clean,"I was some what dissapointed ,when I first use it it did not dry the dishes 100% ,so the second time it did the same so I call GE ,they claimed that the dish washers now are made to save water so in order to have dry dishes you have to use the jet dry wish I never had to before , so now it is better not a 100% but better.",80,"June 19, 2019"
love my third drawer,"I had been washing my dishes by hand due to my previous dishwasher failure.
Strange as it seems, I actually enjoyed it.  However, my dishes and silverware come out sparkling - much cleaner than by hand wash.  Very quiet with functional racks.",100,"June 18, 2019"
So quiet,After running this dishwasher im glad it has a light on the front it is that quiet i cant imagine that a quieter one is necessary.,100,"June 18, 2019"
Does the job,It works fine gets the dishes clean the top rack does not stay in it always wants to slide out wish that it had a rinse cycle have not used it that much yet. Will give a review when l have used it more,80,"June 17, 2019"
None that work,"It leaked since we bought it and ruined our custom made cabinets and I have a claim out with G.E.'s insurance company.  Registered after we bought it inAug 2018, but changed email address.",20,"June 8, 2019"
Great features and super quiet,"If you're looking for a dishwasher that clean all your dishes, nicely designed, and super quiet - this is the one. It is so quiet I didn't think it was working. Does an excellant job of clean all the dishes. I really appreciate the small pull-out tray for small items.",100,"June 5, 2019"
Great Dishwasher,"We've had this GE Dishwasher for 8 months and so far so good. Cleans extremely well, isn't loud at all, grinds up the excess food with the garbage disposal inside and I only need to clean the filter once a week or so. All in all I'm very impressed and very happy with the purchase.",100,"June 2, 2019"
Quiet Dishwasher.,Works well.  Very quiet and dishes get squeaky clean with no water spots.  I use Finish detergent.,100,"June 1, 2019"
So Quiet!,"This dishwasher looks great, has plenty of room and best of all; it's so quiet when it's running. We can watch a movie in the next room and not even know it's on. The cycle takes a long time, but we just turn it on at night and it's clean in the morning. Really happy with this purchase.",100,"May 30, 2019"
Product returned,The dishwasher was not acceptable for us. The racks were made of cheap plastic and the flaps on the utensil holders constantly fell off. For the price this product is cheaply made and is not worth the money.,40,"May 28, 2019"
Great features,I love the look and features. Top silverware rack is fantastic!,100,"May 28, 2019"
Sooo Quiet!,Sometimes I open the door to a working dishwasher because I didn’t know it was running.,100,"May 28, 2019"
I love my new dishwasher!,Very quiet. Cleans great!  Pay attention to items needed on installation.,100,"May 28, 2019"
Runs very  quietly. Looks great!,This DW runs so quietly it is very difficult to distinguish whether the machine is running or not. It matches perfectly the older Adora appliances we already have in our kitchen as well.,100,"May 24, 2019"
Cleans like it should!,"So far, so good with a month or so of using.  Big upgrade over our previous product",100,"May 21, 2019"

Nice dishwasher,"The dishwasher is very nice, cleans well and has tons of space for our dishes. The price was a little higher than l had hoped to pay, but other than that l have no complaints!",80,"May 17, 2019"
I like the silverware drawer,I really like it. It's very quiet and does an excellent job cleaning the dishes.,100,"May 16, 2019"
Very quiet!!!,Very happy with it. Very quiet. Love the upper level utensil tray. Have had one or two times that did not clean as well as it should. Only reason I gave it four stars.,80,"May 16, 2019"
Very Quiet,"Look my dishwasher.  My GE Adora dishwasher was the only one that we found was adjustable to fit the space.  The hardwood floor was put in throughout the house and around the appliances, so we had to have one to go in at 31"" to get into the space to adjusted up to 34"" .  Yes it cost a little more even on sale, I got what I paid for and very happy with it.  Very quiet, you don't even know it is running.  Very satisfied.",100,"May 15, 2019"
Very Quiet!,"Hidden controls, powerful wash, third top tray for delicate items and very quiet makes this dishwasher absolutely perfect. We’ve been using it a few times a week for a couple months.",100,"May 14, 2019"
Great Machine,Well we've only had it for a few weeks now and so far really happy the way it cleans our dishes. We put on the extra dry and everything comes out dry and spotless.We use the Quantun that GE recommends .,80,"May 14, 2019"
OUTSTANDING!,"We had an OLD (probably 12 years old!) dishwasher that came with the house.Still worked but when we purchased a new GE clothes washer, we figured we'd upgrade our dish washer.  We were NOT disappointed with this machine.  My wife is overjoyed with its performance!",100,"May 9, 2019"
Quiet,"Great machine, first dishwasher we have purchased however not the first GE appliance.",100,"May 8, 2019"
Incredibly quiet.,"I heard, many times, about how quiet this model was, so I bought one. Amazingly quiet isn't a big enough accolade -- it's hugely quiet! I stood by it while running and I only heard a whisper. My wife had asked me if I had started the dishwasher. When I told her I began the run cycle 20 minutes ago she thought I was kidding, so she came and stood with me until the 49-minute cycle had ended. Then she believed me about how quiet it is. Huge Kudos!",100,"May 5, 2019"
The top rack is very useful.,I enjoy the exterior appearance and the interior appearance.  Really does a good job of cleaning.,100,"May 4, 2019"
Quiet!!!,"Compared to what we had previously, this dishwasher is super quiet, spacious, and absolutely great!  I like the silverware holder with its separate slots for each piece, and the 'slim' drawer at the very top to hold those items that don't seem to fit anywhere else.",100,"May 2, 2019"
Great Dishwasher,Love the color and all of the features! Love the top silverware rack!,100,"May 1, 2019"
Love it!,Very quiet and love the 3rd rack for sharp knives.,100,"April 27, 2019"
Works great and quiet,We use our dishwasher on almost a daily basis. It does a great job cleaning all types of food particles and is whisper quiet. The third rack is a great feature for baby/toddle shaped utensils that won't fit in standard utensil holders.,100,"April 25, 2019"
Great!!!!,It is so quite compared to my old dishwasher! I love it.,100,"April 25, 2019"
Quiet & Efficient,"I love this dishwasher. I compared so many before settling on this one. I was intrigued by the third rack, and am so glad I got that option, I use it a ton for utensils that otherwise take up precious room. I also love that the middle rack is adjustable, and you can simply pull the third rack out if you don't need it. I like that there's multiple settings depending on how much I've loaded - there's even an option to just wash the ""top half"" or the ""bottom half"". 

I wanted a stainless steel tub, with top buttons so my toddler doesn't start it on accident. (side note, he loves helping mommy close it after we load it.)

I picked the ""slate"" color since I didn't want boring black or white, but with a toddler, I didn't want to constantly be cleaning fingerprints. The handle is stainless and gets fingerprint-y easy.

Definitely glad this is the dishwasher I picked. It's also super quiet - I had to check the first time we turned it on to make sure it was running! 

I also love that GE products are made of a majority of USA parts and manufactured in the USA. It's so hard to come by that (unfortunately) it wasn't even on my list of ""must have features"" but was a very pleasant surprise to see that American flag on the box.",100,"April 25, 2019"
Washes dishs really good,It washes the dishes really good like the sanitizer mode. Only down side is it takes so long to finish the cycle. Very quite machine  compared to the last one we had.,80,"April 24, 2019"
Great looking appliance,We really like our dishwasher.  The slate color looks great and blends into the kitchen really well.  It has both of the features we were looking for:  Gets the dishes on all levels really clean and is super quiet.  We have recommended this to our daughter and they purchased this for their replacement units in her house.,100,"April 24, 2019"
Nice features at a good price,"Nice features and a good price. Can't ask for much more.
It doesn't always get dried food off as well as I'd like and I wish I had opted for the model that had the special glasses jets. But overall pretty good.",80,"April 22, 2019"
Extremely Quiet,"This dishwasher is amazingly quiet.  We are very pleased with the functions, appearance, and quiet operation.",100,"April 21, 2019"
Happy,We installed this in our new home in September.  It works great and is very quiet.,100,"April 20, 2019"
Very satisfied purchases.,"Prior to purchasing this dishwasher I had read many of the reviews which were a bit mixed. When I made my purchase over a year ago this model had not been in production for very long. There wereI many more  positive reviews than negative ones and most of the negative reviews had to do with product issues that did not seem to be related to the actual performance of the machine, but, given the review dates, rather seemed be due to bugs that could be expected to occur early in the production run. This notion was borne out at least in my case. My dishwasher has performed flawlessly for over a year. It does a superior job of cleaning dishes and is VERY quiet. Wash time on regular cycle is about 3 1/2 hours. Use of rinse aid is recommended.  I am glad I bought this dishwasher and would do so again.",100,"April 20, 2019"
Great machine but I'm still learning.,"This is clearly a well-made efficient machine.  It has several options regarding how and what you want to wash.  I especially like the re-conceived flatware shelf at the top.  I also like that you can do the top OR the bottom tray separately.  But I seem to have a terrible time getting my dishes into the right slots, next to the right prongs, without  falling over.  Because I live by myself, I tend to have a lot of different smaller pieces (as opposed to a full dinner for either with a matching set of dishes.  I get the job done, but I'm a bit puzzled about why things were designed the way they were.",80,"April 18, 2019"
"Quiet, cleans dishes well on ""light"" cycle.","Good performance, quiet, dishes are completely dry at end of cycle.",100,"April 18, 2019"
Doesn't dry dishes completely.,Dishes do not dry completely.  There is water on the dishes 24 hours later.  Tub has condensation on walls for several days,60,"April 18, 2019"
"Cleans great, very quiet",We're loving our new dishwasher. No longer have to put things through the wash cycle twice.  It's so quiet you don't hardly know it's running. Love the top rack,100,"April 17, 2019"
Would not buy again,The washer is very quiet. It does clean the dishes well. The drying part does not work. I have tried all the settings but every load is wet no matter what I have tried.,40,"April 13, 2019"
Great features and runs very quietly!!,"I love it so far!  Runs quietly and the boost wash is fantastic for hard to clean items and love the fact that I can sanitize all the dishes, glasses, cups, pots, and pans. By using the sanitize function, it cuts down on colds and viruses being transferred to other family members and friends.",100,"April 11, 2019"
Easy to use and washes great,Super quite.  Love the third trey.  Looks great in the kitchen.,100,"April 10, 2019"
Very Nice product,Love the silverware rack location. Also the operating quietness. I don't think anyone would go wrong purchasing this dishwasher.,100,"April 9, 2019"
Cleans well —- Thats the Goal,Dishwasher cleans well.  I’m  not sure I like the spacing on the lower rack.     The electronics panel went out 3 mos after I bought it.  Still waiting over 30 days  for part that’s on backorder ...,80,"April 7, 2019"
this is a very good unit,"I like this unit better than the unit it replaced because; #1, it works and the other one was failing #2, the third rack for forks, spoons and knifes #3, the stainless steel tub is a very good upgrade #4, It brews tea better.",100,"April 4, 2019"
This dishwasher is perfect for our needs.,I love this dishwasher. Our dishes come out clean every time. I love having a choice to use the third rack or the baskets with covers for silverware to keep each piece of silverware separated. I don’t rinse my dishes but I do wipe them a bit with a paper towel to keep the filter clean. I really like that even with the piranha grinder feature that the dishwasher is still quiet in our open concept home.,100,"April 3, 2019"
Dishwasher,Can’t seem to get top rack to go in aonthe door can ahilut without force,40,"April 3, 2019"
Fast & Efficient,I love our new dishwasher. The features are great and has many options. The look is sleek and easy to clean the outside. I highly recommend.,100,"April 3, 2019"
Our first automatic dishwasher,Still getting used to having an automatic dishwasher. It is a nice convenience.,80,"April 2, 2019"
Good machine,The dishwasher washes dishes great but the design of the silverware rack sucks. The ends fall off if you look at them wrong. Needs work.,80,"April 1, 2019"
So Quiet,This is a beautiful addition to my kitchen. Super quiet and dishes are dry without streaking...thanks to Finish drying agent. Love the hidden top drawer for smaller items and the hidden top control panel. It makes machine sleek and very attractive. Has many settings to customize your wash cycles. You can wash both upper lower shelves together or just keep one to only wash that shelf.,100,"March 31, 2019"
Great Features! Quiet!,Love the hidden controls & the option to was only top or bottom. I also love that I can move the top rack up or down to allow more room on top or bottom.,100,"March 30, 2019"
Came with problems,Right out of the box the start button stuck. It 4 visits from technicians to get it fixed. It appears to be working now.,40,"March 29, 2019"
Good deal for price point,Very quite and plenty of room for all sizes of pots and pans.  Love the 3rd area at top for flat objects.  Plenty of wash options.  Dishes come out streak free,100,"March 28, 2019"
Cleans the dishes!,"This dishwasher cleans the dishes well. Might seem like a trivial comment, but I have had several through the years that did not do a good job. This one does.",100,"March 27, 2019"
Love it except for one thing!,"We have had this dishwasher installed for about 2 months now.  Pros:  quiet!, love the 3rd upper rack, the lower rack fits our dishes and bowls perfectly, cleans well, controls are easy to operate, the silverware basket is great.  Cons:  I only have one, but it is a BIG one.  The location of the soap dispenser.  It took us about a month before we encountered a big problem.  If you put anything in the lower rack close to the soap dispenser, it inhibits the opening of the soap dispenser door and the dishes do not get clean.  This has happened to us 3 times now.  If they had just made the lower rack a bit shorter, this would not have been a problem.  Even something as simple as a skinny water bottle will cause this problem.  The workaround is to not put anything in the middle of the lower rack closest to the door.  But that is wasting valuable dishwasher real estate.  But all in all we are still happy with our purchase but slightly disappointed that is not a 5 star dishwasher.",80,"March 25, 2019"
love that little drawer on top,"We love the dishwasher...it took three times to get it cause the delivery company are not good, but glad we picked this one. I love that I can just wash the lower rack and I love that third little drawer on top...I just need to remember to empty it.",100,"March 20, 2019"
"So far, so good!","It is incredibly quiet. So quiet in fact that I have checked it a couple times for leaks because I could hear the water running over the sound of the machine. The only thing so far is a funny smell, but I bought the Finish dishwasher cleaner pods and I haven't smelled it since.",80,"March 19, 2019"
Very quiet,Would like better spacing (closer)  in the bottom rack for dish plates.,80,"March 13, 2019"
Love it,The dishwasher is quiet and exactly what we were looking for.  It's a very nice looking unit.,100,"March 13, 2019"
Ultra Quiet,Slick design.  Very quiet while running.  Cycles on are the long side.,80,"March 13, 2019"
Great features,I love it.  It is quiet and large enough to serve my famiy’s needs.  I like the choices I have for wash cycles and I love that third drawer.,100,"March 13, 2019"
Classy & works great!,"After 18 years my old dishwasher racks were rusting out.  Wanted to get something to match my stove, also a GE.  Saw this model at an unbelievable price.  Many different features that I am still learning to use as well as adjustable racks to help fit different sizes and best of all, very quiet and does a great job on the dishes.",100,"March 10, 2019"
LOVE to do dishes now!,"I never thought I would like to do dishes, but this dishwasher makes it fun! It is super quiet!!! My kitchen opens to my living room and you cannot hear the dishwasher from 10 feet away. I love the third rack where you can put silverware, knives, and other flat items.  I put my  knives upside down thinking maybe they will stay sharper longer.  We will see.  Overall I am delighted with this purchase! I would highly recommend this product!",100,"March 10, 2019"
Very attractive and so easy to use.,"I Love the additional third tray for knives, Fragile and delicate items.",80,"March 10, 2019"
Great Features/changing location of racks,"So far this dishwasher has performed well, and is sooooo quiet!",100,"March 9, 2019"
Functions as better than expected,Dishwasher was quieter than expected.  Third rack for flatware frees space on bottom rack.  Adjusting middle shelf perfect for sports bottles and travel coffee mugs.,80,"March 8, 2019"
Nice features/Works Well!,"We purchased the GE Adora dishwasher based on our positive experiences with our other GE appliances. We have not been disappointed! The stainless steel interior has plenty of room for dishes and flatware. It also gives you the option of washing only the top or bottom racks. An adjustable top rack is a must for me and this one is easy to use. I wasn't sure I would use the third upper flat rack but it has been handy for larger cooking tools (knives, tongs, etc.) It can be removed if necessary. Cleaning the filter is also easy, just a rinse or slight brushing. If I could tweak one thing it would be the rinse dispenser. The opening is not very large and it would be nice if it had a gauge that actually showed the level of rinse aid. Minor stuff for me. Above all else the Adora does a great job of cleaning and is extremely quiet! My litmus test for cleaning is my tea mug. It's clean, every time. I can not hear it running even if I'm standing near it. It's been a great machine so far.",100,"March 8, 2019"
Fantastic engineering...space and function,"I have owned many dishwashers over the years.  This is the very best!  Form, function, almost no sound when running, 3-levels that maximize the amount of items that can be washed at one time.  Function, squeeky clean silverware, dishes and glassware.  Double the load capacity of my previous dishwasher.",100,"March 7, 2019"
It’s quiet and the items shine.,"It’s quiet, adjustable, has an upper rack and cleans thoroughly.  I’m pleased.  My daughter recommended the product.",100,"March 7, 2019"

Great dishwasher!!,Very happy with the performance of this dishwasher. It is very quiet and does a great job getting dishes clean.,100,"March 7, 2019"
Very silent... Dish Washer,"Dish washer is very good for the price from GE. 
It’s very silent while working. Only concern is it takes long time to complete cycles.",80,"March 7, 2019"
so far so good,GE seems to have the best reviews and we have had great luck with GE appliances in the past. I have many homes that we up graded and remodel and have had used all GE appliances in the past.   I do wish that an option on dishwashers had a quick wash that also had the ability to have Boost or Santi heat options. Professional dishwasher are 15 minute Santi heat and dry options. Lets put this in a home use washer.,100,"March 7, 2019"
Love my GE dishwasher,"I have been very pleased with my GE dishwasher.  Dishes are clean. The unit is very quiet, which I consider a big plus.  I have no complaints and would recommend the product to anyone interested in an appliance!",100,"March 6, 2019"
"Cleans dishes, looks great.","This dishwasher works as expected for a new appliance. Everything comes out clean. However, water sits on the tops of cups and usually do not dry all the way. Otherwise, we like it a lot.",80,"March 3, 2019"
Great looking in Slate,"Had initial problem with lower wash level not working-had a issue with the lower wash water supply.  Part ordered and is on back order.  Repair man showed us what was the problem, and we keep using the unit, having to push the check ball back down because it stuck.  after awhile, it appears that it has quit sticking and the machine is washing dishes perfectly.  Still waiting on the replacement part.",100,"March 1, 2019"
So quiet,Extremely quiet; great cleaning even when selected normal cycle.  Love the 3rd shelf for small items and the ability to wash top or bottom racks or both.,100,"February 28, 2019"
3rd rack is a real plus,"Love the third rack, adjustable middle rack, top cleaning only feature and how quiet it runs!",100,"February 28, 2019"
It's OK,This dishwasher does it's job. Stainless steel tubs have no venting so there's no place for steam to go. having to open up after running to let steam out is only problem.,60,"February 28, 2019"
Attractive & Quiet,"I purchased this dishwasher in Slate to match my refrigerator.  It look's great.  The hidden controls make it look even better.  Steel tub, steam clean feature, large capacity, etc.  It is very quiet during operation also.  I am very pleased with this purchase.",100,"February 28, 2019"
IT WORKS!,"Great dishwasher with many features some I personally won't need but, nice to have just in case. Only problem was with the waste water hookup. Washer didn't come with the standard outlet, have to buy an adapter for this.",80,"February 28, 2019"
Great dishwasher,"Works great, simple controls, silent operation, reasonable price with promotion",100,"February 28, 2019"
Great Washability,"This dishwasher replaced a 4 year old GE piece of junk. This one washes great, the 3rd shelf is really a help, and it looks good.",100,"February 28, 2019"
Good value,"The dishwasher looks great and  performs very well. I like the third rack and the adjustable middle rack. The machine runs quietly, but the door springs are  a little noisey when opening and closing",80,"February 28, 2019"
Ultra quiet and efficient,"Love everything about my Adora dishwasher. Quiet, efficient, set up well and first dishwasher I’ve owned that I can actually fit all dishes in even large pans. In fact my daughter is going to purchase same dishwasher with same features because I won’t let her have mine.",100,"February 28, 2019"
Great quality,We have many GE appliances and have been very satisfied with all of them.  Dishwasher is very quiet.  Love the third rack feature. Also very nice to be able to wash top rack as we very often only have enough to fill top rack.,100,"February 28, 2019"
"Super Quiet, cleans great","I love the features it does have: third rack, adjustable top rack, stainless interior, and half load option.

I was upset to realize that it does not have a rinse only or express wash option. And although I should have read in better detail about those options, with the price point and other features, I assumed them to be included as well. 

My other feedback would be about the cycle time. I pay for features and like to use them, so I almost always pick the ""Auto Wash"" usually with steam, sani, and heated dry. This is a 261 minute cycle!!! That is over 4 hours, too long in my opinion.",80,"February 28, 2019"
So quiet wasn't sure it was working,"So far we love our new GE dishwasher.  It's so quiet we weren't sure it was working.  Great features too!  If we ever move, I'll buy it again.",100,"February 28, 2019"
Wonderful dishwasher,Love this dishwasher! It’s very quiet and gets the dishes sparkling clean.,100,"February 28, 2019"
So quiet!,"This dishwasher is so much quieter than I even anticipated.  The small item pullout at the top was a happy accident! Never thought I would use it, however it is a wonderful feature that is used daily.  The top drawer can be lifted for large items in the bottom.  Mine stays in that position almost all the time, because I can still fit my glasses, small plated and bowls on the top rack! It makes the bottom spacious enough for whatever pots and pans I have.  This is by far the best dishwasher that I’ve owned!",100,"February 28, 2019"
The dishwasher is working great!,"Although the dishwasher is working great, it does take a lot longer to wash the dishes than my previous dishwasher.  Also, mine has a third drawer, and the second drawer that holds the glasses and such will NOT stay closed, it opens everytime when I open the dishwasher door.  I've had the repairman here to fix it but in a 5 minute (almost) timeframe he told me there was nothing he could do.  SO FRUSTRATED with this!!!!!!!!  Apparently the washer is not level somewhere and it does not have the feet on it (had to be removed to install it) so that can't be adjusted.  Any ideas??",80,"February 18, 2019"
My great dishwasher,Initially I’ve always been against the idea of buying one of these due to so many bad reviewes. However after finally making the move I have to say I am great full. This dishwasher is amazing and has finally saved me from the labor of always washing dishes by hand.,100,"February 14, 2019"
Excellent,The very best dishwasher I ever had very quiet excellent etc etc,100,"February 13, 2019"
Very quiet machine,Easy to install had to put my ear up to it to make sure it was running.  Love the touch buttons on the top.,100,"February 13, 2019"
Do NOT buy,"First, it took 3 MONTHS for this dishwasher to be delivered. Second, it arrived missing parts. Third, it is cheaply made resulting in immediate cosmetic scratches from normal everyday use and of course cosmetic issues and NOT covered. My brand new appliances look absolutely atrocious after just ONE week of normal use. Do NOT waste a penny. You WILL be disappointed shortly after arrival. Very unhappy with this purchase.",20,"February 10, 2019"
Great features!,"I am absolutely thrilled with my Adora dishwasher! That machine is so quiet, I forget that's it's running! I love the stainless steel tub, the third rack, the fact that I can just run a upper or lower zone wash. Initially I didnt think I would ever use that, but I have and it worked wonderfully. This was the best purchase!",100,"February 8, 2019"
Really quiet!,"Unlike our old dishwasher, you can't hardly hear this one while it's running. Storage capacity is excellent. I docked one star because I do need to rinse carefully before loading or dishes don't always come out clean.",80,"February 7, 2019"
Super quiet,"Excellent cleaning, nice capacity and super quiet.",100,"February 6, 2019"
Whisper Quiet,"The Aurora is so quiet I have to look at the light in front to be sure it is running.  It holds more dishes than my old one and the top, third shelf, is so handy for those small items that take up a lot of space, i.e. spatulas, but are relatively small.",80,"February 6, 2019"
Quiet and efficent,"Not only does it look good in our kitchen, this machine is quiet, clean, and efficiently powerful.",100,"February 2, 2019"
Quiet,Our GE dishwasher is very quiet.  Our kitchen is next to our family room and our old dishwasher was so noisy you could not hear the TV.  It also cleans and dries all the dishes with no residue. We are very happy with the look and performance.,100,"February 2, 2019"
Very quiet & Love features,Looks and run great! Has many features to choose from and quiet while running.,100,"February 2, 2019"
Musical dishwasher,"Love the look, the third rack, silverware separator, adjustable top rack, and most of the depth/spacing on the top rack.  My dishes and bowls don't fit into the bottom racks well and there is no way to adjust this.  I probably won't ever use the separate wash zones, but I suppose it would be good if you don't create a lot of dishes.  Its cleaning power could be improved, but liquid detergent seems to work better than powder, even in the pods.  It has a fun little feature - it plays a little tune when the cycle is finished.",80,"January 31, 2019"
It's an average diswasher,"My first dishwasher leaked, so I had to wait 1 month to receive a replacement.
Dishwasher looks fine, but takes a long time to run through a cycle (182 mins).  I tried to run it without the heat dry, but the dishes are very wet if this cycle is not used.",60,"January 31, 2019"
good features,"dishwasher is quiet, like 3rd rack and stainless steel interior.
Racks could be better, don't hold glasses and dishes as well as
I'd like.  Still need to rinse dishes well before using dishwasher or they
don't come out clean.",60,"January 31, 2019"
Good value,"This machine provides a lot of bang for the buck. It is quiet, looks good and gets the dishes clean.",80,"January 31, 2019"
Great,Runs quiet and cleans great. Upgraded from 15 year old unit. No comparison we feel like we never had a dish washer before...,80,"January 31, 2019"
Adora dishwasher,Very quiet operation. Cleans dishes well.  Easy to losd.,100,"January 31, 2019"
Super quiet,"Love this dishwasher. It is soooo quiet. Wasnt sure i would like the hidden controls, but I really do. Looks great in my kitchen. Love this line so much we purchased an adora gas range. Super happy with my purchase. It does run a bit longer than my old one, but the feature of being able to run different levels makes up for that. I have not had any problems loading my dishes. If you understand the design concept and keep that in mind, it's really quite simple. The manual does give you loading ideas if you need it.",100,"January 31, 2019"
Wow this dishwasher has all the bells and whistles,"Oh my everyone who has came to our home to see our remodel loves our dishwasher...

Great features!,"LOVE the NEW black slate color!  No fingerprints!  LOVE the adjustable racks and tines, along with the additional 3rd top rack. LOVE the stainless steel interior.  A BIG plus is how quiet it runs and how well it cleans the dishes, because we don't rinse them off ahead of time!!  We also like the hidden controls to make it more clean looking in appearance.  So far, we have been very satisfied with our dishwasher and would highly recommend it to our family and friends.",100,"January 25, 2019"
Dishwasher,Great dishwasher.  A number of different options and gets everything clean. Would highly recommend,100,"January 25, 2019"
Best dishwasher ever,This is the best dishwasher we have ever owned! It does an awesome job of cleaning what we put into and is so quiet I have thought that it wasn’t running when it was. I would give it more stars if it was possible!,100,"January 24, 2019"
Great clean options.,"Quiet, multiple cleaning options, good style, excellent value for the price",100,"January 24, 2019"
I love it. It has an extra shelve,I love all the extra features    I like that I can do upper or lower wash,100,"January 24, 2019"
Dishwasher is Quiet & Cleans well BUT....,"The racks have openings that are too large in places and could be made smaller and still have effective cleaning. Likewise with the flatware rack; the holes in the bottom are too large so some of the flatware stems poke through the bottom. The openings could be made smaller and still have effective cleaning. My older dishwasher was made with smaller openings overall, and it cleaned very well. The element in the bottom of the dishwasher is also exposed, and I prefer an enclosed drying element. The enclosed type dry just as well, but without danger of melting anything on the bottom rack, or anything that may accidently fall out.",80,"January 24, 2019"
Great for the price!,"This washer holds a lot (capacity was my #1), it's quiet enough (but if you don't want to hear your washer at all, go for another option), and the zone washing is super cool. The only thing is that it shows every droplet of water and fingerprint on the outside panel (hence the 4 stars). Overall very pleased!",80,"January 24, 2019"
Dish Washer,"Great appliance,  runs so quietly that sometimes I check to see if it is running.  Don't have to wait until night time to run because of noise.  Cleans very will.",80,"January 24, 2019"
Early review of dishwasher,"Love the top flat rack for spatulas, long knives and such!  Where has this been all my life?",80,"January 24, 2019"

Dishwasher,Needs work to become a better dish washer. I shoould have looked at other washers before buying this one.,20,"January 24, 2019"
Quitest Dishwasher I’ve Ever Owned,I really love this dishwasher! It’s very efficient in removing dried on food even without having to rinse the dishes before putting it in the dishwasher. It’s super quiet too!,80,"January 24, 2019"
Above average dishwasher,"Washes pretty well, though we rinse everything first. Third rack is very convenient to save space for other dishes. Cleans adequately on shorter cycles, though glassware and silverware could be cleaner. Pretty quiet machine. Only issue so far is that the plastic faux chrome end caps on the handle break very easily--$70 part to replace the entire handle bar. Not good design on that part.",80,"January 24, 2019"
Love is a Quiet Dishwasher,We moved into a house built in the 90s and I think the dishwasher was that old. You couldn’t stay in the same room when it was running because it was so loud and it left puddles of water on everything. This GE is wonderful - it dries completely and you cant even hear it’s working until you get right up to it and listen.  Great Job GE!,100,"January 24, 2019"
Very Quiet,Love our new dishwasher! It is very quiet and does a great job on cleaning our dishes.,100,"January 23, 2019"
Quiet,I don't even hear it running!  My last dishwasher was so loud I had to run it at night.  My new one I start after dinner and we don't hear a thing!,100,"January 22, 2019"
Average,"Purchased 1 yr ago in Slate finish, looks very nice. DYI installation was difficult. Paying extra for the install is well worth it to avoid the headache. 
Started leaking immediately so we couldn't use it until repaired. Needed a new solenoid, which was covered under warranty at no charge. No problems since.
Does not do well with cheap brands of detergent, any type. I've been using Finish powerball tablets with good results, but sometimes there's a white residue on plastic containers. Also, I have to run the sink faucet until hot prior to starting. As long as I do that and load it properly it cleans the dishes well. 
Cycles are long. Normal with heat dry is 175 min., heavy wash with dry is 225 min. I start the washer after supper and it's still not finished when I have to go to bed, so I can't unload it before bedtime. 
I do like the upper third rack for large knives, utensils and small items, very handy.  It's also quiet when running.",60,"January 19, 2019"
Horrible,Your product is horrible. The dishes don't come clean,20,"January 18, 2019"

Great features,"We went looking for a dishwasher that handled are everyday simple burdens that we had with our older dishwasher (15 plus years).  Some of this issues where the soap dispenser would not open all the way because a plate was in the way, silverware holder was not wide enough to hold large spoons, and the inner rack be can to rust.  So now with our new dishwasher we have a rack for the odd shaped silverware and serving spoons in the  top rack, adjustable racks for more room, and both the upper and lower racks are coated to prevent rusting. Also did i mention that the dishwasher soap dispenser opens!! gone are the days of chiseling out stuck in soap!! All simple enough features that make it a big deal.",100,"January 18, 2019"
Cleans Well but Has Issues,"Installation is kind of difficult, especially leveling and adding screws into side cabinets.  The holes in the side of the dishwasher for screws didn't line up with the",60,"January 18, 2019"
Average Dishwasher,"Disappointed as we have found food particles still on dishes and they were not baked on particles.  I had been rinsing my dishes before putting them in the dishwasher and decided not to as it is not recommended because of the sensors within dishwasher so I tried it a few times.  Needless to say, I am back rinsing my dishes before putting them in the dishwasher.  Dishwasher is quiet though.",60,"January 18, 2019"
Great dishwasher!,"I know of several people, with new dishwashers, that complain constantly that the dishes are never clean.  This dishwasher is awesome!  Dishes clean and shiny.  Wasn’t sure if I would like the third rack (for silverware) but I don’t think I would get another dishwasher without it.  Love that it is easy to clean the filters also.  Controls on the top of the door so we don’t accidentally hit them by leaning against the dishwasher.",100,"January 17, 2019"
A breath of fresh air,"I love this machine!  It is very quiet - I almost can't tell it's running.  It cleans thoroughly and dries well.  Controls are easy to use. Racks slide easily and smoothly.  The third rack is of limited use, but is very nice for some items that are odd shapes.  It replaced a machine that was noisy, slow, unreliable and didn't dry the dishes.  This machine has none of those faults.",100,"January 17, 2019"
Nice to use,"Replaced a three year old GE model that was running well as we purchased three other GE appliances of a different finish.

"Quiet, thorough cleaning, great capacity",This dishwasher is so quiet some times you forget you have it on.  It has great cleaning and optional drying features.  Adjustable racks including silverware tray are wonderful.,100,"January 17, 2019"
Excellent machine,"I've had my dishwasher now for about 2 months, so fair amount of time to give it a fair review.  I had no idea I would appreciate a machine until now!  It cleans total yucky dishes beautifully, amazingly quiet and looks as sleek as can be.",100,"January 17, 2019"
Should be priced much higher,"The features are comparable to much more expensive dishwashers. The look is very clean and it is amazingly quiet. I have to look at the indicator light to know if it's running. It seems the higher priced dishwashers are getting overly gimmicky, like your dishwasher texting your phone or vice versa. This thing rocks.",100,"January 16, 2019"
Very Quiet!,Very happy overall with this machine!  We could hardly hear the machine running when in the wash cycle.  Significant improvement over our 11 year old Whirlpool.,100,"January 16, 2019"
Love the Quiet!,"I can truly say, this dishwasher is so quiet I cannot tell that it is running.  I gets the dishes clean, easy to set the functions.
But the quietness was an unexpected bonus!",100,"January 16, 2019"
Wonderful Dishwasher,"I have had this dishwasher for 3 months now and I am very happy with my purchase, this replaced a Maytag that gave me endless problems.  It is very quiet I have a hard time telling if it is running. My dishes come out clean.  I really like the 3rd top shelf, I use it for the silverware. Setting it for delay, is easy, I really like that it shows how much time it will run.  The only thing I have found I have a hard time with is putting in the rinse agent, the opening is not a good design and I have found I need to use a funnel to get it in and not spill all over.",100,"January 15, 2019"
Works and looks great,"Dishwasher is great addition to our kitchen. We love the look, quietness and overall functionality. The third rack and adjustable racks are nice features.",100,"January 13, 2019"

"Very, very quiet.","Great machine, good price, very quiet, and we love the appearance..",100,"January 11, 2019"
Dishes are sparkling and it's very quiet,"I really like the 3rd rack for flatware.  Everything comes out sparkling clean.  It's super quiet!    I'm still trying to get adjusted to the other racks and wish there was an area on the bottom rack that would adjust for smaller items such as prep bowls and condiment dishes.  The top rack is also a challenge when trying to secure glasses.  I have an assortment of glass sizes and they just don't seem to fit well.  I find myself  washing some by hand.  Also, I don't use the outside handle to drape a towel as it lands on the floor when the door is open.  Overall, it definitely cleans well.",80,"January 11, 2019"
Great Dishwasher,Love the look and especially the performance of the machine.,100,"January 11, 2019"

Versatile and Great Cleaning,"This dishwasher cleans better than my last one.  The third rack is surprisingly useful.  I miss having adjustable supports on the top rack, but most of our dishes fit anyway.  I added a flip down wine glass support from an older machine !  I am rating this only good because it leaves a lot of water on the tops of things even on the Heated Dry setting.",80,"January 10, 2019"
Great Features,I have been using it about a month and so far like the features. It runs very quietly.,100,"January 10, 2019"
Super Quiet and Strong Features,"Just got this in the last few months.  We replaced a super old one.  The benefits of the super old one is that it was fast.  I think all dishwashers now are slow.  However, we love the third rack, it is super quiet, and dishes feel very clean.

It looks great and works great!",80,"January 10, 2019"
works great,replaced all our appliance with the GE brand and we love the features on the dishwasher and it is really quiet!,100,"January 10, 2019"
Quality Dishwasher,I recently purchased the Adora GE dishwasher and I am amazed how quiet it is. It  does a great job of cleaning the dishes. easy to use. I like the top silverware tray.,100,"January 8, 2019"
Really liked it until control board went bad,We really like the GE Adora series Stainless Steel Interior Dishwasher with Hidden Controls.  Was quiet and loved the 3rd top rack.  After 18 months had some intermittent power outages with first heavy snow in Nov. and control board went out.  Warranty was for one year.  Not buying another GE dishwasher.,40,"January 6, 2019"
Problems from the start,Within 6 months control board needed to be replaced. It now looks like control board has to be replaced again. The unit is not consistent in it's ability to clean. Dispenser has failed on several occasions leaving a solid chunk of soap to clean out. The beeping and annunciator codes are not well documented. The water wounds are falling apart and appears to have melted on the ends.,20,"January 5, 2019"
"LOVE IT, IT LOOKS GREAT","I bought it on March is nice and works perfectly, not noise.",80,"January 5, 2019"
GE Dishwasher,"This Dishwasher is the QUIETEST Dishwasher I have ever had.  I have to put my ear to it-- to make sure it's working  And, it IS  :)    Cleans my dishes Squeaky Clean!",100,"January 4, 2019"
Works great,"Replaced our same make dishwasher, love the utensil shelf.",80,"January 4, 2019"
Awesome,This dishwasher is so quiet I don't even notice it running.  It cleans and dries really well.  I got it just before Thanksgiving.  It was a life saver.,100,"December 30, 2018"
Awesome Dishwasher,"We bought this product in November and have run at least 40 loads of very dirty dishes.  The top flatware feature is great as well as the fold-down racks on the bottom shelf.  Regardless of what we put inside, everything comes out clean and dry!  So very pleased with our new dishwasher.",100,"December 30, 2018"
Great features and quiet!,"Purchased the GE Adora dishwasher based on its features, positive reviews and a great price but mostly because we've had excellent luck with other GE appliances. This dishwasher is quite roomy inside and has a must for me--the ability to raise or lower the upper rack. In the highest position it will accommodate larger cookie sheets on the bottom.  Lower it and my tallest wine glasses fit comfortably in the top. It has the third rack for flatware, knives and other utensils. I don't know yet how often I will use this feature but it is a nice option. I can definitely tell a difference in how well it works compared to our previous 5-year-old dishwasher, which was not a GE. Flatware is so shiny it looks new. The real icing on the cake is how quiet the Adora operates. We absolutely do not hear it working! I actually have to lean over and put my ear to it to tell it is running. Very happy with this appliance and I highly recommend it.",100,"December 29, 2018"
Works Great!,"I've been using this dishwasher for about six weeks. It cleans excellently, and is very quiet.",100,"December 27, 2018"
super quiet,I bought this to go along with our GE wall ovens and microwave. This is the quietest dishwasher we have ever had. The changeable height of the top drawer is awesome for taller glasses and pots. Dishes come out sparkling clean.,100,"December 27, 2018"
GE Dishwasher,"This dishwasher is so quiet! I love that I can start this dishwasher anytime, and I can still have a conversation in any room in the house, and hear everything. My old dishwasher could only be run after everyone went to bed because it was just flat out noisy. This has been a great upgrade, and I’m very happy with it.",80,"December 27, 2018"
Great dishwasher.,Super quiet. Love the 3rd tray for silverware. Cleans great. Very happy with this washer.,100,"December 27, 2018"
Great dishwasher,I bought this a couple of months ago and I love it.  I recommend it.,100,"December 27, 2018"
I love the QUIET!!!,My dishwasher that was replaced by this beauty was loud!!!  I was so pleasantly surprised by how quiet this one was. I was not surprised at how great it cleaned my dishes though!!!,100,"December 26, 2018"
"Easy, Quiet and Efficient","Bought the dishwasher a couple of months ago, and have been using it heavily. Easy to understand operations.  Controls are simple.  Some of the dishes are cleaner than they have been in years.  Never really used dishwashers, but had to replace one that I neglected.  I will use this one constantly.",100,"December 25, 2018"
Dishwasher review,"I purchased this for our new home after the fire and didn’t do my homework well enough when shopping. I did’t realize this dishwasher does not have capability to raise or lower the upper shelf if needed for a pot lid or cookie sheet etc. you can not even put a pancake turner in with the silverware or the arm dispersing the water hits it. Cookie sheets, cutting boards etc are too big.",40,"December 20, 2018"
Easy to use,Using for 2 months very good results.  Cycles seem a little long but results are great.,100,"December 20, 2018"
Runs SO quiet !!!,I've had my new dishwasher for about 3 weeks and I LOVE it !! It gets all my dishes really clean and I can't even tell it's running. The racks pull out smooth and the ability to raise and lower the top rack is a bonus.,100,"December 20, 2018"
Great looking,I purchased this dishwasher to match the other new GE appliances I needed for my new kitchen.  This unit has all the features I looked for and more in a dishwasher.  I really like the top 3rd tray for small items and utensils.  So far the cleaning has been good even with the hard water I have to deal with.  Lots of room for pots and pans.  MOST of all .... It is so QUIET.  I can hardly notice that it is on and will no longer have to worry about doing a delayed wash whenever I have quests over for dinner anymore.,100,"December 16, 2018"
Nice,"You need stainless steel cleaner to clean but it looks nice once used. Love the 3rd tray but even on the boost option, not everything always gets clean and with the dry option, not everything gets dry at times.",80,"December 16, 2018"
Completely Silent!!!,"I absolutely LOVE this dishwasher! The top rack for the silverware is just amazing, and makes it so easy to put your silverware away. It also allows for more room on the bottom rack for more dishes, and I even put in baking dishes and pans and they come out looking brand new!  And it's so quiet, you can't even tell it's running!",100,"December 15, 2018"
Dishwasher,"I bought our dishwasher about 4 months ago and have loved it. The top rack is great for washing baking sheets that don't usually fit well on the racks down below in most dishwashers. I don't need to pre-wash my dishes and they almost always come out clean. If not it is usually my fault because I was hoping something that was really baked on would come out without having soaked/pre-washed it at all.
Also it is SO quiet. We've really been impressed with that and it is especially helpful because our kitchen is open to our living room.",100,"December 14, 2018"
Dishwasher,"Very quiet, stackable & efficient. In general we like GE products",80,"December 14, 2018"
Super quiet and cleans very well,I love how quiet this dishwasher is..  I also love the third rack on the top and how much the dishwasher holds.  My only dislike: fingerprints on the stainless- but that was my choice.,100,"December 14, 2018"
new one,Has worked fine. no issues with it. It does the job.,100,"December 14, 2018"
The most quiet thing ever,"Bought it three months ago, and this thing runs so quiet compared to the ones I grew up around, and it goes well with how my open kitchen is is hear it for sure, but I can't",100,"December 14, 2018"
Quiet!,"I bought the dishwasher this summer to replace our old one.  I find it a very functional dishwasher and very quiet, so quiet I sometimes put my ear up to it to listen closely to make sure it is running. The door is a little tricky to close. I need to close it a certain way but I don’t hold that against it. It’s a good dishwasher.",80,"December 13, 2018"
Great 3rd Rack,"I bought the DW a month or so ago. Great features, washes well and the 3rd rack is very practical.",100,"December 13, 2018"
Cleans well,The DW cleans dishes very well but seems like a long time to wash every time 2.5hrs for normal.,60,"December 13, 2018"
Great Dishwasher,I am so happy with my Adora Dishwasher.  I requested a quiet and I got it.  I am so pleased with it I would recommend it to everyone.,100,"December 13, 2018"
Wonderful,This dishwasher is easy to use. It is quiet and has great features. I love the extra rack at the top. I love that my dishes are getting clean without pre-rinsing.,100,"December 13, 2018"
Adora Dishwasher,The cycle seems long. over an hour.  Somewhat noisy,100,"December 13, 2018"
2nd one I've bought--still a winner!,"This is the 2nd GE Adora dishwasher that I have purchased.  Both times I have been 100% happy with the cleaning,  low noise level, design, construction, and the appearance of this dishwasher.",100,"December 13, 2018"
Great dishwasher,"This is the third one I’ve purchased because I like the features. It’s very quiet and I really like the dual zone feature. Being an empty nester we don’t always fill the machine, so we use this feature a lot! I just wish they had left the silverware container at the front of the machine.",100,"December 13, 2018"
Super Quiet!,"Arrived fast, installed myself and was fairly easy. Machine looks great and is super quiet!",100,"December 13, 2018"

Cleans great ! Very quiet.,Excellent product. Looks and cleans well. It makes my kitchen look first class.,100,"December 4, 2018"
Died within a month,Bought this dishwasher in August and it came delivered with broken parts. By September it had completely died due to circuit board failure. It is December and dishwasher is still not fixed. Dishwasher is very poorly made with cheap parts and there is a definite parts availability issue from GE affecting timely repairs. Would not recommend this dishwasher due to parts issue. Also the design of the upper sprayer is poor and the sprayer part continually falls off.,20,"December 4, 2018"
GREAT FEATUREES.  VERY QUIET,"We had bought this same model at a prior home and when we bought a new home we bought the same one again.
Love this dishwasher",100,"December 4, 2018"

Strong construction,"We've had this dishwasher less than 2 weeks, yet I like the steel tub construction and the operation of the machine.",100,"November 25, 2018"
Best dishwasher EVER!,"This dishwasher is so quiet, I barely know it's even running! 
I love the upper and lower water spray, the 3rd pull out drawer for utensils, the ability to raise and lower upper rack if I have large dishes on bottom rack. 
I seriously love this dishwasher, it exceeded my expectations!",100,"November 25, 2018"
"Super fast, envy of my friends",We have had this dish washer for 10 months. All my friends are jealous of the whisper quite operation and the fast clean and dry sequence.,100,"November 25, 2018"
Prefer my old dish washer,"I liked my old dish washer better ,!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!",20,"November 23, 2018"
Super Quiet,"We bought this dishwasher about two months ago when we moved into a new home.  I absolutely love this dishwasher!  It is so quiet, I can barely tell when it is running!

Quiet,"This is the best dishwasher we have ever owned it is so quiet the only way you know it is running is the discharge water going down the drain.
ps. great job GE",100,"November 18, 2018"
Does the job,"It's ok. My dishes are clean and that's what matters. But opening the finish liquid door is terrible, I list a nail one time. It's also difficult to keep it clean on the outside. Hand prints show all the time",80,"November 16, 2018"
Great features!,I bought this last week and the product works great,100,"November 16, 2018"
Very quiet and outstanding cleaning,Bought a year ago. Well worth the money and very quiet.,100,"November 15, 2018"
Beautiful and oh so Quiet!,"We had bought this to replace the GE dishwashwer that was in the house when we bought it, we have hard water here in AZ and it had a rough life.
I am not brand loyal, but honest about my experiences.
Anyway, we selected this unit primarily because it was in our budget, it had a good variety of settings and versatility with the adjustable racks, the fact that the interior was all stainless, and most important- how quiet it was.
We have a very open floor plan and we used to have to raise the conversation level to drown out the dishwasher, now I have to keep checking it to see if it is on, but its been a few weeks now, and I stopped. 
The first time we opened the door after the wash cycle, we were stunned at just how clean and spotless everything was compared to our old unit!
We of course used the recommended tabs and rinse agent which are not that expensive (I realize thats just an oppinion, but isnt this whole review?) and it worked out great!
So far so good, havent tried the hardest cleaning settings yet, but havent had to!
Normal cycle seems to do the job for what we throw at it, but with the holidays approaching we will soon be throwing everything at it! I will update this review after that.
Sincerely- Family of 4.",100,"November 13, 2018"
Very quiet -great job cleaning and drying items,This dishwasher is so quiet.  It does a great job of cleaning and drying the dishes.  Best dishwasher I ever had and it wasn't the top of the line pricing.,100,"November 12, 2018"
Great Dishwasher!,Just bought this dishwasher and love everything about it and it's SO quiet! My only complaint is that the Slate finish doesn't exactly match the finish on the Adora gas range and fridge.,100,"November 11, 2018"
Poor installation instructions,I am a automotive mechanic and I feel sorry for DYI homeowners that attempt to install this Dishwasher.,80,"November 11, 2018"
Very quiet!!,"I couldn't wait to get my new appliances! Quiet, sleek and beautiful!  I love it!  Makes my kitchen shine!",100,"November 11, 2018"
Clean dishes,Can't tell if it is running and when finished dishes are clean and sterile,100,"November 9, 2018"
It works perfectly.,We love the dishwasher.  It works perfectly it’s very quiet.,100,"November 9, 2018"
Very good features overall,We have had it s few months - I love the lower and upper silverware/utensil holders . But the upper tray everything slides to the center.???,80,"November 8, 2018"
Clean dishes!,"We have had the dishwasher for about 3 months. It does a wonderful job of cleaning dishes even with stuck on food. The old problem we've had was the start button sticking in the down position. It was replaced but it feels like it is starting to stick again. It isn't sticking because of anything we've done or spilled on it, it sticks because it feels like the interior and exterior shell parts move apart and pinch the button. No idea how they would fix it. So, I hope it doesn't happen but may have to replace it with a different type of dishwasher if the problem persists.",60,"November 8, 2018"
Love it!,We bought this as an appliance bundle and couldn’t be happier. Pleasantly surprised with the many features it has.,100,"November 8, 2018"
Great Appliance,This appliance is very easy to install yourself. The instructions included made the process very simple.,100,"November 7, 2018"
Washing,"I thought with the steam that surely this .dishwasher would let me put slightly dirty dishes in and they would come out clean but not so, : (",60,"November 6, 2018"
Great,I bought this 4 months ago and it’s been great so far.,80,"November 3, 2018"
Just as expected,I have been very pleased with the way the dishwasher works.  Have had it for about 2 months with no problems.,80,"November 3, 2018"

Awesome dishwasher,Thus dishwasher is efficient and is a beautiful addition to our kitchen. It quietly washes and dries our dishes. I would highly recommend it to anyone!!,100,"October 30, 2018"
Soooo Quiet!,"This is effortless to load, and is super easy to operate and very self-explanatory for its operation. Very quiet, can hardly tell it's running. I really like the third (upper) shelf for smaller/long items. I wish it had a stem rack )like previous GE models) to keep stemware in place.",100,"October 30, 2018"
Great product,Love it great product don’t mind doing dishes anymore..,100,"October 27, 2018"
Very efficient and worked very well,We had a 10 years old GE dishwasher that worked really well. We are remodeling our house now so we replaced it with this one and we are so content about it looking foreword for another 10 years.Great product. Go GE,100,"October 23, 2018"
GE ADORA Dishwasher,I installed this yesterday and it works great! Very Quiet!,100,"October 21, 2018"
Great Features especially  the drawer glides,I bought this machine because of the features and I love ge products.,80,"October 18, 2018"
All seems to be great,"Works as expected, has great look and is QUIET!  Love that.  I'd recommend running the heating cycle so that you don't have wet dishes.  Only thing I've noticed.  But we've only had for about 72 hours as of now.",80,"October 15, 2018"
Dishwasher,"This has been the best dishwasher we have ever had, very quite, can’t hear it run at all, always gets the dishes very clean and dry",100,"October 9, 2018"
Very nice unit,"I bought this unit last week, when it arrived I did not open the door on the unit, after installing my wife noticed that the roller on the lower tray was missing (we later found it under the heating element) . I’m now trying to get a replacement for the broken one",60,"October 8, 2018"
Quiet,Beautiful stainless steel front with hidden controls,100,"October 7, 2018"
"Beautiful sleek design, wonderful features!","I can't say enough good things about this dishwasher. I purchased it to replace a 16 year old dishwasher by another manufacturer. My old dishwasher was so noisy and seemed to run forever. This dishwasher is whisper quiet and is finished a load in a reasonable amount of time. Also, the drying function works better in this dishwasher than in other washers I've used in the past. Also, the controls on the top give this appliance a modern appearance. I would definitely recommend this appliance to anyone who is looking to upgrade without spending a fortune.",100,"October 6, 2018"
Best Dishwasher Ever,"So quiet, all dishes come out clean & the finish is beautiful & fingerprint free. Very happy customer.",100,"October 6, 2018"
Great machine,This machine was a reasonably-priced upgrade over our prior machine.  It cleans well and is not too loud.  Would definitely recommend.,100,"October 5, 2018"
So Quiet and clean,"Best dishwasher I have ever had. It’s super quiet, it cleans to the point of spotless and uses low water consumption",100,"October 4, 2018"
I Fear I'm too dumb to use this,"For some reason, nothing is intuitive to me these days.  I would love to receive a printed manual but those days are gone.  I tried tonight to use my dishwasher, model #DDT595SMJ4ES, for the first time and I cannot get it to start.  I turned on my laptop to find directions and I did what the directions indicated I should do.  It still hasn't started.  My guess is the machine is fine and that I'm doing something incorrectly.  It should not be difficult to start a dishwasher.",20,"September 30, 2018"
"Works well, but panel faulty","We bought this two months ago and we have enjoyed using it. The features I like are 1) the conteol panel is on the top of the door instead of on the face of the door (keeps little hands from turning it on and off), 2) he extra silverware drawer on top is a nice place for lids, etc., and 3) the steam feature is a nice addition! The only downside (and the reason for the 3 stars) is that our “start” button already broke! The repairman mentioned that the plastic piece under the button has been a frequent offender in this model. Bummer! I am under warranty right now, but I am not looking forward to frequent repairs in the future. My previous dishwasher from another company never needed repair in the 6 years we owned it...kind of regretting replacing it!",60,"September 28, 2018"
Amazing Dishwasher!,"I purchased my dishwasher for my condo, even though there was a new one in the unit.  This one is so quiet, I always have to touch to make sure it is running.  Having a small condo makes it imperative to invest in better quality - this dishwasher saved the day!",100,"September 25, 2018"
Very quiet,I feel this dishwasher is a good value.  It's washes well and has lots of room inside for everything.,100,"September 24, 2018"

easy installation",100,"September 24, 2018"
Super quiet!,Does an excellent job of cleaning the dishes and is the quietest dish washer we have ever owned.,100,"September 21, 2018"
Great dishwasher!,Our dishwasher we had for 30 years died a few months ago. We had planned to buy a different brand but liked the features on this GE Adora when we were shopping. I love the dishwasher so far!  I use the boost temperature and it gets the dishes super clean. I like that I can opt out of using the “dry dishes” setting—which can melt plastics and uses more electricity which is super high where we live.,100,"September 20, 2018"
Everything is great about my new dishwasher.,"This was the best dishwasher I have ever had, so quite. Have to look at the light on the front of the door to see if it is still running or has stop.  The 3rd rack on top is out of this world.  So good for very small items.",100,"September 20, 2018"
"Love all the features, especially the third rack","Great dishwasher with all the features we wanted.  Have used it twice and the dishes were very clean.  Extremely quite!  Modified the installation by hooking up power cord, drain hose and waterline to dishwasher before sliding it into cabinet, since there is very limited space to do it after the unit is in.  Made sure that cord and hoses were pulled in correctly by moving the unit in about 8 inches at a time.",100,"September 20, 2018"
Does the job but poor quality,We've had this dishwasher for less than 9 months and an important part inside keeps falling off which causes it to leak ALL OVER THE KITCHEN. Its awful.,40,"September 19, 2018"
Very Quiet,"I've had my dishwasher about 2 weeks now. It is almost too quiet--I can't always tell if its running or not. I really like the third shelf on top, also. I only wish it was a little easier to stack the dishes. The bars and uprights are spaced fairly far apart so smaller dishes and glasses can be hard to stack upright.",80,"September 18, 2018"
Super quiet!,We bought this product to replace a 15 year old dishwasher and the difference is amazing.  It cleans much better and is almost impossible to hear.,100,"September 15, 2018"
Quiet!! Easy to Install,Very happy with this dishwasher! Glasses are spotless and incredibly quiet!,100,"September 15, 2018"
Very quiet!,Love love love!  Quiet and strong.  This dishwasher is able to decide how long to clean. I now know that when I open the door I will not have dirty dishes.,100,"September 15, 2018"
No Noise,"I bought all GE appliances for my new house.  The first time I ran the dishwasher, I had to listen very very carefully for it didn't seem to be running, but it was!  No noise whatsoever.",100,"September 13, 2018"
So quiet!!!,l love this new dishwasher.  It's super quiet and really gets my dishes clean,100,"September 13, 2018"
Works fine.  Wash Cycle is VERY long,Bought this washing machine. It's fine.  But the wash cycle is VERY long and the controls are a bit finicky.  It does a great job cleaning the dishes though.,60,"September 13, 2018"
Product looks sharp!,Havent really used the product much yet as it was just installed but it looks great and is very quiet when running.  The first one came damaged from the warehouse but was reordered and delivered quickly.  Overall happy with our purchase.,80,"September 12, 2018"
Happy so far,"Had the dishwasher installed in mid July 2018, have enjoyed the options on this model.  The dishwasher is quieter than most models I have come across.  The dishes come out and they are clean and dry.  We have extremely hard water so I have to use a lot of the rinse additive.  The only problem I have had is the top rack does not slide back into place easily every time.",100,"September 12, 2018"
"Quiet, but powerful!",I finally found a good dishwasher that doesn’t require a pre rinse.,100,"September 12, 2018"
Great dishwasher!,"We have had our dishwasher for a little over 3 months now. It is very quiet, and cleans our dishes fabulously even when just rinsed off. I love the way the buttons are hidden (it comes in handy with little children)
The only draw back is the dishwasher does take a long time to complete the normal cycle. They have a faster option however, it doesn’t clean as well and doesn’t dry the dishes.  I have a large family and Need to run it multiple times a day.... this does leave my sink with dirty dishes from time to time.",80,"September 11, 2018"
Very Quiet,This dishwasher is very quiet.  I love the utensil drawer.,100,"September 11, 2018"
Excellent features,Excellent cleaning & drying. Much more quiet than the Bosch we previously purchased.,100,"September 10, 2018"

Great Dishwasher,It washes dishes great. Very Very quiet. Easy to program.,100,"September 8, 2018"
Features are not so great,"Wish I had more knowledge before this purchase or we would not have. The racks are thin and cheezy and not dish friendly to hold. Also having the top button feature is not working as it hides under the counter top and can not see the time or what cycle it's on. It can also take's up to 3 hrs to wash a load! The silverware rack is not moveable, would have like it in the front!
 The good, it does run very quiet which was the mail reason for the purchase having a great room",40,"September 8, 2018"
Easy to use!,I am loving having this quiet and strong dishwasher.,80,"September 7, 2018"
So far is working fine,We got this dishwasher about a month ago and so far we love how quiet it is and the room it provides. With a house of 5(3 adult 2kids) and usually familyfriends come over for dinner we fill it quickly.  It's still pretty new so we'll see how the far it goes. Will keep you posted.,100,"September 7, 2018"
great dishwasher,"we downsized into a smaller 5 year old home we had originally built as a mother in law cottage.  the original dishwasher was very loud and, while ok for small loads, was not suitable for my wife, who cooks large meals.  we did our research and decided on this model.  could not be more satisfied.  very quiet, (which is great in a small home), lots of cleaning options, and performs great on all.  highly recommend this product.",100,"September 7, 2018"
Quiet!,I'm pleased by how quiet this dishwasher is. I also like the separate utensil drawer. It cleans well also.,80,"September 6, 2018"
great disappointment,"We had assumed that most dishwasher shelves were designed to accommodate a similar layout of dishes.  Not so.  The KA that we gave up had an upper shelf that had four rows that were just slightly wider than most of our glasses and cups and they all fit and stayed upright and made good use of the space. Not so with the GE.  The rows are half again as wide as most of our glasses and cups, and the base is so irregular that it is nearly impossible to line up a batch of glasses and cups and not have them flopping around.  We attempt to wedge them in some sort of zig zag pattern to have them keep each other upright, but seldom is this successful.  The bottom shelf is a similar disappointment.  The flatware tray on top is the only physical design that I would like in a replacement.  The only feature that we are pleased with is the noise level.  It is very quiet, and consequently doesn't remind you that inside is a big jumble until you open it up.",20,"September 6, 2018"
Tough install,Love it after the install. Its quiet and gets the dishes clean as a whistle! Problem was the install. I have been a Plumber for more than 35 years and GE is by far the most difficult to install because of the parts that should be installed by manufacturer are field installed.,60,"September 6, 2018"
Great Features,Its amazing. Quite possibly the best thing I ever bought.,100,"September 6, 2018"
Awesome,"Works great. Love the top knife rack. Spacious for large plates, pans, pots",100,"September 6, 2018"
It works but needs to be improved!,"I bought this 8 months ago and it does do a great job cleaning the dishes but I will buy something else next time. The racks are set up for different glasses and dishes than I have, the top rack can be lowered to give the glass rack more height but then it hits my plates (normal size plates). When it is raised I cannot put water bottles in the rack. Also the rack spacers are too small to put coffee mugs and some glasses in so they have to straddle two spots wasting space. Also it was suppose to be QUIET but has a high pitch sound though out the wash.",60,"September 5, 2018"
Good value,Purchased this in the spring and so far it is working well!,80,"September 5, 2018"
Great features!,"LOVE LOVE LOVE this dishwasher! I love the top 3rd rack for silverware, knives, straws. And the adjustable 2nd rack means nothing in the bottom rack is ever too tall! The bottom rack has pieces that can fold out of the way when I have pots/pans that need flexible space. Can't say enough good about this - game changer!",100,"September 4, 2018"
Quiet,This is the most quiet dishwasher. Can't tell if it's washing or not it's so quiet.,80,"September 3, 2018"
This dishwasher does a great job!,"I bought this four months ago to replace a 17 year old machine. It does a great job. All I have to do is scrap off food scraps, load and wash. It's remarkably quiet. We can turn it on in kitchen and sit down to watch TV in next room and can't even hear that it's running. We stream everything first which really cleans well and then air dry with door partially open. As long add you use Final Rinse, works great.",100,"September 2, 2018"
"Quiet, washes well","This dishwasher is quiet and gets the dishes clean.  At first I thought the top level flatware rack would be useless, but I have found it works well for cleaning dish lids instead of standing them up in one of the lower racks.",100,"September 1, 2018"
Quiet,Rinse feature. My model doesn’t have the rinse feature so I use the light wash feature with no detergent. Works great,100,"September 1, 2018"
Great features,"Just installed it 3 days ago, but so far it's working great.",100,"September 1, 2018"
"Many features, super quiet","First the pros about this model.  I love the 3rd row top tray for long utensils, scrub brushes and/or long kitchen knives.  The unit is very quiet and hardly noticeable even when standing right next to it while running.  It has a ""steam"" feature which works nicely to remove caked on food. Great at washing dishes even with food particles still on them.  Cons. The unit has a large handle which protrudes outward about 2.5 inches.  The handle sticks and my washer is directly under my counter top where I prepare my meals. It's a bit annoying but I have gotten used to it.  I like the controls being hidden and out of sight but the ledge collects crumbs and/or debris often. It is easy to wipe clean though.  I installed it myself with the help of a small adapter.  My house is about 30 years old and I needed an adapter for the water feed line. Not a big deal but just thought I'd mention it. Overall I am very pleased with the washer.",80,"September 1, 2018"
Quiet it,Super quiet and easy install. Recommend braided hose install kit vs. the original copper line we initially tried. Love the third rack and stainless tub. In line garbage disposal a great feature. Did I mention how quiet it is?,100,"August 31, 2018"
updating all my appliances,i brought this dishwasher because i recently brought a GE stove and referator.,80,"August 31, 2018"
Best Dishwasher I have ever owned!,"SO VERY HAPPY with my dishwasher! It has so many wonderful features, the untensil rack alone is amazing, you can break it down & place the baskets in various areas & the dish rack can be set at different angels or flat to give you plenty of room or options for loading. The numerous wash cycles are a nice bonus as well. It is so quiet, I have to stand next to it to tell if is running. I like the light in front to indicate where it is in a cycle & the little chime whwn it is finished. My dishes alway come out nice & clean, pots & pans no problem too! I have never had a problem with wet dishes, after a cycle. Also love the top ""3rd"" rack it is really versitile! I can use it for silverware, cooking utencils, knives etc. Did not think I would use it, I was wrong! By far one of the best investments I have made in a long time! I like it so much I taked a friend into buying one too!",100,"August 31, 2018"
It's so quiet,Bought this a month ago it's so quiet and the dishes are so clean. Love this dishwasher,100,"August 31, 2018"
Good Dishwasher,Overall good dishwasher.  The only issue has been that water seeps into the soap pod dispenser.  The seal on the compartment should be tighter.,80,"August 30, 2018"
Very quiet,"Installed during my kitchen remodel and really like the machine.  The lower rack doesn’t hold plates very well, the sets of times are spaced a bit too far apart for my bowls and my plates are square and pop up.",100,"August 30, 2018"
Excellent product,"Unit is quite, efficient, loads easily, has excellent capacity, accommodates varying loadingings, good water consumption and is easy to operate to use.",100,"August 30, 2018"
Not what I expected,"Have been using this dishwasher for almost 2 months and have mixed feelings. Thought I was going to love 3rd rack. Well, I don't, because everything on it stays wet and if you unload that first all the others dishes get water dropped on them too. Also it doesn't dry as completely as my last dishwasher as well as very difficult to load efficiently. I've researched how to load it but can't seem to fit all the dishes it says you can. And it runs forever. On the good side, dishes are clean.",80,"August 30, 2018"
Satisfied,It works as expected. Lots of space for dishes and utensils.,100,"August 30, 2018"
So quiet!,"We’ve had this dishwasher for a few months now and we are so happy with the upgrade. Compared to our ancient and now deceased old dishwasher, this unit gets our dishes so clean, we rewashed everything in our cabinets when we got it. It’s nearly silent in operation, easy to program cycles, and the top tray rack is perfect for our baby’s tiny plastic feeding gear. Very happy with this purchase.",100,"August 30, 2018"
Super quiet!,"We selected this model because it had a third upper rack for utensils, it had all the features we wanted, came in white and was super quiet.",100,"August 30, 2018"
Great dishwasher!,I bought this a few months ago and I love it. It is very quiet and cleans really well. I also like having the third rack.,100,"August 30, 2018"
Very quiet and lots of racks.,"Very quiet, can't hear it running, top controls out of sight, special top low profile rack for knives and forks. Great dishwasher.",100,"August 30, 2018"
Has everything I need!,I love this dishwasher.  Very easy to use & quiet!,100,"August 30, 2018"
Big dishwasher!,"We have been using for about 4 months now and love it. I love the color and the size inside. I can fit all my large pots and lids in it and the control menu is not on the outside which I love. The top sliding compartment is great for my spatulas but it did take a few loads to get used to it being there! Really nice dishwasher, and we are very happy with it.",100,"August 30, 2018"
Disappointing Purchase,"We bought this dishwasher 4 months ago and are not happy with its performance overall. The cleaning agent does not always empty completely from the dispenser, the dishes have to be practically hand washed before loading and yesterday it quit working altogether. Previously it would start a cycle then stop. Very disappointed in the quality and appearance of the stainless interior. Wjsh we had not purchased this.",40,"August 30, 2018"
Great job cleaning,"We bought this dish washer about two months ago and
we're happy we did .",100,"August 30, 2018"
Not what I expected,My wife and I really like the design of the lower racks that GE uses.  We were happy to see that the glass rack could be lowered to accommodate large wine glasses.  It has a new (to us) top rack to hold extra cutlery or small items. However we were very unhappy after taking deliver of the dishwasher that we could not wash dishes and long stem wine glasses with the rack lowered at the same time.   I am now wishing we didn't have the new top rack so it would accommodate dishes and tall wine glasses which we use every day.,80,"August 30, 2018"
Love it,i bought this a few months ago and I love it. I just rinse and push the bottoms. It cleans and shines the dishes. Never have had a bad experience with it,20,"August 30, 2018"
Smudge proof,"I love this dishwasher. I love the 3rd shelf,and the fact that it is smudge proof.",100,"August 30, 2018"
Quite and Efficient,This dishwasher has been a great addition to our kitchen.  It is much quieter than our previous dishwasher.  We really like the rack design - lots of room for various sizes of dishes as well as cooking pans.,100,"August 30, 2018"
Quiet and efficient.,Bought this several months ago and it works great. The quietness of this dishwasher impressed me immediately. I thought it wasn’t running at first then realized it was. Cleans everything very well. Overall very happy.,100,"August 30, 2018"
"Works well,, but",The  prongs  for  holding  gushes  upright  could  have  been  designed better . my  plates  tend  to  flop over a  lot,80,"August 30, 2018"
Very happy,"Love the adjustable rack and the 3rd rack, highly recommend getting a 3rd rack",100,"August 30, 2018"
Only adequate,"Along with the other kitchen appliances in our newly constructed condo, the Andora was used in the model and ""suggested"" for each unit.  The slate finish looked new, sleek and appealing,  This model would not be considered top of the line but kept us ""close"" to budget allowed.  I would not choose the hidden controls because of difficulty to see when door is closed.  Also, at times door doesn't latch correctly without extra force so when unit is set to start, it doesn't actually start,  Now I have to wait a few minutes until the running water is heard so I know the cycle started.
The configuration of interior posts does not allow good cleaning between cereal bowls and smaller plates do not fit well in either section.  The small upper shelf that is supposed to be used for utensils sounds like a nice idea, but only quite flat items allow this drawer to close completely,  Spatulas with bent blade do not fit there.
Noise level while unit is running is quite low, but the cycle is extremely long and the rush of water through each changing cycle is heard at the sink.  
The most disagreeable feature is that even with rinsing dishes before they are put into unit, a smell is noticed each time the door is opened,  Interior size makes it necessary to run more often than expected (or experienced from previously owned dishwashers) but the smell between washing cycles also encourages that shorter time of having unwashed dishes in the unit,  I don't put cooking pots and pans in the dishwasher, but don't see how they would fit along with daily serving dishes unless the unit were run every day.",60,"August 30, 2018"
Nice look.  Ok function,We've had the dishwasher for about 9 months and it's nice looking but I expected dishes to come out cleaner,60,"August 30, 2018"
Great Dish washer,Love it. Washes dishes like a dish washer should..,100,"August 30, 2018"
We love our dishwasher,"We purchased this dishwasher about three months ago, and feel in love with it the very first time we used it. It does a very good job, getting the dishes clean. The best part is it is so very quiet. You hardly know it is running.",100,"August 29, 2018"
"Sleek Exterior, Great interior","We love the exterior look with the controls hidden on top, but the light showing the status of the wash. Stainless Interior looks really nice. The little pull out shelf up top is awesome for larger spatulas and spoons. I love that the top rack is height adjustable. Great feature! It does seem to take a long time, but we run with the Sani feature, so that increases overall runtime. I love that the screen shows how many minutes the cycle type you've selected will take. Overall great dishwasher.",80,"August 29, 2018"
I love the third rack!,I have used it only twice but both times I was impressed by how quiet it is and how clean and dry the dishes are.  I love the third rack. It is great for those small plastic lids that otherwise may bounce around.,100,"August 29, 2018"
temperature hot,will bye again love the qualty very guide you can talk when it is running,100,"August 28, 2018"
I miss my old dishwasher,"We have had the GE Adora for about a year now. It often emits a high pitched noise while in cleaning mode, I have to wash dishes a second time often and the detergent dispenser usually has about 1/4 - 1/2 of the pod left in it at they end of the cycle, which probably accounts for the white film that gets left on the dishes. There is almost always an odor in the dishwasher and on dishes after cleaning, no matter how much I clean the filter, which is something I never had to do in our previous dishwasher.",60,"August 28, 2018"
Super Dishwasher,"Bought this a couple of months ago along with a matching range and microwave.  This washer is excellent, heavy-gauge metal, clicks like a real piece of machinery when opened and close.  Very quiet   The third rack on top is really smart and we use it all the time.  Love this unit.",100,"August 28, 2018"
Sleek and effective,"The front side looks very clean which I love but it also if very functional. The top rack is nice and deep which allows for tall cups, wine glasses, etc. The cycle times are a little longer than I'm used to but everything comes out clean!",100,"August 26, 2018"
Love it!,After being without a dishwasher for the past 5 years this is the best dishwasher I have had.,100,"August 26, 2018"
Practically perfect dishwasher!,"We've had our Adora dishwasher a couple months now and we're so happy with it. It's not only wonderfully quiet, the dishes/utensils come out clean and dry every time - no matter how packed it is. The features we love...the third rack, being able to wash just the lower or upper rack, the smudge proof slate gray finish. It's really a practically perfect dishwasher!",100,"August 25, 2018"
Excellent,I purchased this appliance and 2 others at the same time,100,"August 24, 2018"
quiet and cleans too!,I have had it for a month.  Easy to install.  Cleans well.  Looks goos.  Is quiet. Reasonably priced.,100,"August 24, 2018"
Quiet,"Our old dishwasher died and this one was a good price. It has 3 racks, with the third being to cutlery. It seems to have less room although it sits in the same space as the older one",80,"August 24, 2018"
So quiet!,We love our new dishwasher! It is so quiet and the top rack is a great addition!,100,"August 24, 2018"
Good features and looks great,"I have had this a couple of months, very happy with how it cleans and how quite it is . Like the third rack and the movable silverware rack.",80,"August 24, 2018"
"Very quiet, cleans well.","Was sceptical of the brand because we were not happy with the last one we had.  It's been about two months now and we couldn't be happier.  Super quiet, and it cleans very well.",100,"August 24, 2018"
Bad Experience,"I receive new packed machine all wet even manuals and other accessories were dripping with bad smell.
I cleaned it and after installation machine refuse to dry my dishes, what a bad experience pain and torture for two weeks.",20,"August 24, 2018"
Love this dishwasher!,"I’ve only had it for a few months, but so far I love it. It is super quiet, the dishes come out sparkling clean and I love the extra pull out shelf to put spatulas and lids on, although it is completely hidden and sometimes I forget things are there and they go through a second time!",100,"August 24, 2018"
Super quiet,I love the top extra rack. I also like that the top rack is adjustable. The dishwasher is only a few feet from the living room and you can’t hear it run it’s so quiet. Cleans the dishes great.,100,"August 24, 2018"
Quite quite love this dishwasher,This is a great GE dishwasher it cleans great and is very quiet,100,"August 22, 2018"
Excellent product.,"I bought this a month ago after reviewing a lot of different products.  I didn't think I'd use the 3rd (top) drawer very much, but it's come in very handy for items too tall to go in the bottom bins, as well as small lids.  Yes, the cycles are very long but (for me) that's a 'who cares'.  Super quiet and it cleans everything extremely well.  I found it IS necessary to use a rinse aid.  Very happy with this purchase.",100,"August 19, 2018"
Love!,"Super quiet!  Can hardly hear it running and that’s only if it’s quiet in the room.  Beautiful slate finish is a great addition to my remodeled kitchen.  Holds and separates dishes and silverware well and I love the very top pull out tray for spatulas, tongs and large knives",100,"August 17, 2018"
I've replaced the same part four times,"Dishwasher is stylish and fits nicely into the kitchen, however I've replaced the circuit board underneath the buttons four times. I've become a professional at taking  apart this dishwasher. Cleaning is decent but I've seen better. Just really frustrated that the same part keeps going out. This last time, I didn't even replace it. The dishwasher is now just a big paperweight in my kitchen used for storing things.",40,"August 16, 2018"
Very quiet.,I bought this 5-17-2018. was scheduled to install 7-3-2018 but the leveling legs were missing so could not install. Ordered legs and installed 8-11-2018. Saw water leaking from the lower right side of the door once but it did not leak on the next try. will watch for this in future. had a hard time installing insulation in door and trying to keep it clear of the vent.,80,"August 14, 2018"
Such a quiet and awesome dishwasher!,"We just installed this dishwasher after having a very loud Whirlpool for over 12 years and what a huge difference in the noise reduction and how well this GE cleans!!! We just ran 2 cycles thus far, but we are VERY SATISFIED for the noise reduction alone! We had to look at the light on the front to realize it was running!",100,"August 12, 2018"
Great features!,Love so many things about this dishwasher - definitely worth purchasing!,100,"August 8, 2018"
Adora dishwasher,We’ve only had a for almost a month and we are totally satisfied with our purchase!!! It’s quiet and the top rack feature for the bigger utensils is perfect!,100,"August 4, 2018"
Great Dishwasher,"After only a few uses, it is apparent that this is one outstanding dishwasher.  It cleans much better than our previous (much higher priced) dishwasher.  It is exceptionally efficient, very quite and it's design is a very pleasant addition to our kitchen.",100,"August 3, 2018"
Another Amazing GE product,I bought this a week ago and I could not be more happy with it. Our hole kitchen has GE products and they are amazing.,100,"August 2, 2018"
Very quiet,"It has been a little less than a month since we got GE Adora, it’s extremely quiet, the features are suitable for our family needs. The most important thing is that the dishes are spotless and the top shelf is deep enough for tall glassware. So far it’s perfect.",80,"August 1, 2018"
Is this thing on?,"I am most impressed with the lack of noise coming from the DW while running.
It also does a splendid job cleaning!
Looking forward to many years of service.",100,"July 31, 2018"
Exactly what I wanted and expected,"Great brand, great features, right price point via Home Depot.",100,"July 30, 2018"
Great Dishwaser,"This is a truly great dishwasher. The dishes come out sparkling clean, there is zero noise and it looks great in my kitchen!  I love the very top 3rd rack which is perfect for large utensils and small items.",100,"July 28, 2018"
Nice dishwasher,"Seem like a nice dishwasher. It is to new to do a full review,",60,"July 28, 2018"
Great options!,Just had installed and switched the kitchen aid and got this one.  Love the third rack and the height control on the second rack. My only complaint is the fingerprints are awful they don't wipe off -you think they are gone and boom they are right back.,100,"July 24, 2018"
Top Line Dishwasher for an Amazing Price,"Dishwasher is luxurious to look at, practical design that is the best I've ever had, and it really cleans all my dishes, pots, pans, and flatware.  Put everything in dirty and it comes out clean.  Two things: Make sure you clean out the filter every week in the bottom of the dishwasher, and don't put the detergent pod (if you use those) in the detergent dispenser, put it in one of the flatware tray holders in the bottom rack.",100,"July 24, 2018"
Is it on?,"Never worry about an open floor plan again, with this dishwasher in the  kitchen, its so quite we had to ask ourselves, did we forget to run the dishwasher cause we rarely hear it when its on, amazing!",100,"July 24, 2018"
Good So Far - Super Quiet,"We've had this dishwasher for a couple weeks now and it is working great.  It is SO quiet, you hardly know it's running.  Cleans dishes well and I love the upper flat rack, which I've never had before.  Still getting used to the controls.  Only giving it 4 stars because my husband installed it and it was a nightmare. He is a handyman by trade but if you are trying to level it while it fits into the cabinet, it is impossible.  You need to try to level, pull it out, level, push it in - it's not level...pull it out, level, push it in, not level.  Very frustrating way to get it right.  After several tries, we got it.  Other than that, the dishwasher itself is great.",80,"July 23, 2018"
Amazing,"Love how quite my new dishwasher is, and  looks great in my new kitchen .",100,"July 21, 2018"
Wonderful machine,"Straightforward installation, super quiet, love that third tray for silverware and little things, but mainly cleans so much better than the Jenn-air it replaces: 30% lower cost, and a much better result.",100,"July 21, 2018"
So far so good,"I bought this model after our old ge model went out and other than the insulation being very hard to maneuver into the space provided, it works like a champ!",80,"July 20, 2018"
"New, but LOVING this so far!","This dishwasher has a beautiful look.  It is quiet--amazingly. It has a heated dry setting!  (Thank goodness...I like my dishes DRY and ready to put away.  (I save energy by running it less frequently, as it is large enough to pack full of many dishes.)",100,"July 20, 2018"
Sleek and quiet.,We purchased the bundle. Very happy with overall look and performance. Very Quiet and love adjustable shelf and dividers.,100,"July 19, 2018"

Very Quiet Dishwasher,Replaced an older lower model dishwasher with this one and was immediately impressed with how quiet it is when running. The shelves are adjustable and I really like the top smaller shelf. I would recommend this unit.,100,"July 17, 2018"
We're very pleased,"Two very competent gentlemen installed our new dishwasher in about 25 minutes this morning.  We love the appearance, and my wife is especially fond of the ""buttons"" on the control panel.  Many previous reviews have mentioned how quietly this machine runs.  We ran it empty, just to see for ourselves what 48 decibels sounds like.  It is eerily quiet; we couldn't hear a thing without standing immediately next to the dishwasher.  So far, it doesn't leak, and I don't know why that would change.  We don't know if it gets dishes clean, or dry; time will tell.",100,"July 16, 2018"
So Quiet!,"I bought this dishwasher to replace an older one in my home.  Love all the features, but truly amazed at how quiet it is.",100,"July 15, 2018"
Very nice dishwasher,So cool the dishwasher doesn’t have the pop up center spout so it’s so easy to load and get your dishes clean. Love it!,100,"July 9, 2018"
All the Fetures and Super Quiet,"This purchase is to replace a 3 year old similar GE model.  Very happy with the purchase.  As stated in the title, it has everything we were looking for, and its even quieter than our last one.  Win-Win!",100,"July 9, 2018"

"Super quiet, the top 3rd rack is amazing!","This dishwasher is not loud at all. Runs very quiet, I can hardly tell it’s on. I’m a huge fan of the 3rd tip rack which holds flat utensils like large knives and spatulas. My last favorite thing about this dishwasher is that the longest runtime is about 2 hours.",100,"June 19, 2018"
Very Quiet,Purchased 2 weeks ago and have only used it 2 times. Extremely quiet dishwasher! You have be right next to the unit to even know it is on. Dishes come out clean. Love the ability to use the top or bottom or both racks.,100,"June 18, 2018"

Good Value,"This dishwasher is so quiet, it's hard to tell if it is running or not.",100,"May 30, 2018"
"Quiet, roomy and effective","We are very pleased with this dishwasher. It cleans efficiently and quickly, and it’s so quiet you hardly notice it. The layout with the 3rd drawer on top gives us the extra room we need. We run it once a day and haven’t run out of space yet. For a family of eight that’s really impressive!",100,"May 24, 2018"
"Quiet, Clean and Easy to Use",The title says it all. This is exactly what we wanted. It also looks great.,100,"May 19, 2018"

So quiet!,This  dishwasher is living up to all my expectations. It cleans like a champ! It is very quiet we have to walk up to it to see if it we remembered to turn it on.,80,"May 1, 2018"
Very quiet!,I’ve had this dishwasher for 6 months & am pleased with it. It’s very quiet - barely noticeable from the next room (kitchen open to the dining room). Cleans thoroughly. Plastic wear on top rack gets almost totally  dry - much better than my old machine. Water pools up a little on items on top rack unless I use a finishing rinse.,100,"May 1, 2018"
Not My Favorite Dishwasher,"My dishes do not all come clean.  I have been trying different settings.  I am, also, trying different soaps.",60,"April 30, 2018"
Great dishwasher!,Love the extra top rack. Washes great and looks terrific.,100,"April 30, 2018"
Pleased with purchase,So far so good. Love the extra top shelf for flat items. Love the adjustable 2nd shelf. The nlynthing I haven’t figured out the dry cycle. Dishes came out wet,100,"April 30, 2018"
Dish Washer,"Cleans great, very quite, you will not know it is running",100,"April 29, 2018"
Quiet strong motor,This new era of GE appliances is out of this world! They have upped their game the last few years. Reminds me of Hyundai,100,"April 26, 2018"
wonderful dishwasher,It is so nice to have a dishwasher that actually cleans the dishes and leaves them sparkling!  Love my dishwasher!!!,80,"April 23, 2018"
Great features.,First time with a GE dishwasher and absolutely love it!  So quiet!  Love the 3rd rack and the deeper 2nd rack especially.,100,"April 22, 2018"
Quiet,"We have had the dishwasher for about 2 months.  It is nice and quiet, and cleans well.  I would have liked the upper rack to be friendlier to use.  Cereal bowls and small glasses do not always stay in place during opening and closing.",80,"April 22, 2018"
Quiet & Effecient,"Great product, fair price.  Excellent delivery & installation.",100,"April 22, 2018"
all went well,no owners manual found to operate dishwasher now looking online to find one?,80,"April 22, 2018"
"Very decent, but...","We like our dishwasher, as it is very quiet.  This is important to us, as our kitchen is open to the family room.

It is a little disappointing, as to lower the plate dividers in the rack, 1/2 the rack must be done, rather than 1/4 at a time as our previous washer did.  Thus, when lowering this for a single pot, a lot of space is wasted.

The other negative, is the size of the silverware holder also takes a lot if space, so we continue to use the old one, as it comes apart into thirds, and we rarely use more than 1/3.

Nonetheless, the dishes always come clean, and this is what matters most.",80,"April 21, 2018"
Great performance,"We just installed our new dishwasher today replace 12+ year old GE Profile. I run it twice to test out. The dishes came out dry, no spot. It is quiet than I expected. I love the additional features (select upper/lower), 3 racks and better design to fit more.",100,"April 21, 2018"
So quiet!,"We shopped around and looked at several different brands and models. In the end, this one best met our needs",100,"April 20, 2018"
Poor Installation Directions,One document used for many models; some steps did not apply or seemed out of order,80,"April 18, 2018"
We adore our Adora,We decided for the Adora because of the roomy interior and extra flatware sliding tray; so useful for the long utensils! It is so quiet that we sometimes wonder if it is really going. It does a really good job cleaning and drying the dishes and we also like that we can select to run only the top or the bottom rack to save time and energy. We are happy with our purchase!,100,"April 18, 2018"
Great dishwasher,Works great and has alot of space for big bowls and other stuff!!,100,"April 17, 2018"

Great choice!,I’ve had this installed for a week. Excellent cleaning and very quiet. We are very pleased with the slate color as well.,100,"April 14, 2018"
Issues with having NEW dishwasher leaking!!!!!!!!!,I just don't understand when you purchase TOP of the line GE products WHY we should have problems with each item we bought! DO YOU?,20,"April 13, 2018"
"Well built, quiet, doesn't dry well","Purchased over a month ago.  The controls are easy to use.  It's easy to load and unload.  The dishes come out clean.  It just doesn't dry dishes as well as other dishwashers we've owned.  There's a fan that runs after the cycle and you have to leave the door closed to let it work.  Still, items (especially plastic ones) don't completely dry.
We found that feature that allows customers to configure the silverware basket into 3 sections caused people to accidentally spill flatware all over, so we used plastic tie wraps to secure the 3 pieces into one unit.
Still, it's a quality unit.  Dishes come out clean.  There is no soap residue or excessive spotting.  It's just the drying that bothers us a little.",60,"April 13, 2018"
Awesome dishwasher,I love this dishwasher.  It is so quiet and the third rack is so useful.,100,"April 12, 2018"
Great Dish Washer,"This dishwasher is much quicker than our old one, and does a much better job cleaning even difficult dishes.",100,"April 11, 2018"

Installed Today,Happy so far. Much more quiet than our previous washer. Will update if anything changes.,100,"April 5, 2018"
"Clean dishes, annoying rack","This dishwasher does a great job, all my dishes come clean.  I also like the top rack for knives and small items.  I'm not so happy with the middle rack.  It does not stay closed, and will open by itself and has hit me in the head when I'm loading or unloading the bottom rack.",80,"April 5, 2018"
Simple Installation,"When in easily as planned, runs unbelievably quiet.",100,"April 4, 2018"
Great features,Very happy with this and I would recommended this to anyone,100,"April 3, 2018"
Very Quite,"I purchased this dishwasher last month and am very pleased with the unit overall.  I did the install myself and found the instruction a little confusing and eventually had to just step back and use common sense.  I was most impressed with how quiet the nit is. My old unit sounded like I was running rocks through the garbage disposal, this thing just purrs in the background.",100,"April 3, 2018"
Good except for some minor design features,"This replaced my 14yr old GE dishwasher.  Operation of machine good and extremely quiet.  Do not care for the additional curved bar at the top outside of the door, instead of the normal single hidden handle in center.  Most annoying is the extra slim shelf added at top - cuts down on total space.  Even when I removed mine to make more space, the machine will not take wine glasses standing upright.
Would have preferred a higher quality GE but virtually nothing comes in white anymore.",80,"April 1, 2018"
Amazing,"I bought this three weeks ago and I can't believe how much better it cleans my dishes.  My old dishwasher had a broken hinge but I thought it still cleaned good.  Since it was 10 years old I decided to replace it.  This dishwasher cleans so much better without have to use all the extra softeners I was using.  Now I just use finish and jetdry and everything sparkles, no prewashing either.  Also love the silverware drawer along with the basket.  This dishwasher seems so much bigger than my old one.  It is worth the money.",100,"March 31, 2018"
mini drawer,love the mini drawer for knives and long utensils.,80,"March 31, 2018"
Works great.  well built,We have used for a month love it  cleans well and very quiet,100,"March 29, 2018"
Very quiet,I used my new dishwasher several times as we prepare to move into our new home.  It’s so quiet compare to what I use to have.  Love the  flat rack too!,100,"March 28, 2018"
Doesn't fully dry,"It is a very quiet dishwasher, however, it doesn't dry dishes fully.",60,"March 27, 2018"
Cool utensil rack,This dishwasher is very quiet.  Stainless steel interior.  My favorite feature is the utensil rack/drawer above the glass rack.  We use these little condiment bowls all the time and they used to always get in the way in the glasses rack. They fit perfectly in the utensil drawer.  Another great GE appliance.,100,"March 26, 2018"
Just a “whisper”,"Very quiet barely hear it, I like the top rack for knives.",80,"March 26, 2018"
takes too long,The back wall stays wet for a long time after drying and I do use heat dry. This can not be right. Had it serviced and he could not find anything wrong.,60,"March 24, 2018"
Love it,I love my dishwasher it’s so quiet and does a great job cleaning my dishes!,100,"March 23, 2018"
Practicly silent!,Love this appliance. Replaced a 25 yr old GE dishwasher that never had a problem other than old age. Does a great job and holds a lot of dishes. Lots of great features. I can’ t tell it’s on unless I really listen. A pleasure to use.,100,"March 23, 2018"
dont buy one,I have had my dishwasher now for 3 months and still not used it as I am waiting for a part,20,"March 23, 2018"
Sweet machine,Bought about 6 months. Not one regret or problem. Sooo quiet.,100,"March 23, 2018"
Second one we have purchased,"We originally purchased for our beach house.  We liked it so much, we purchased another one for our home.",100,"March 23, 2018"
Fantastic,"This is probably the best dishwasher I have ever used.  The black stainless is so much better than regular stainless; so much easier to keep clean.  Not to mention the outstanding performance at actually cleaning dishes.  If you have super dirty dishes or pots and pans and punch up all the settings it does take a long time to clean, but the results are outstanding.",100,"March 23, 2018"
Quiet,"I love this dishwasher! Besides being quiet, I like the top rack for knives & lids, I like that the top rack can be removed if I need to have taller glasses on there, I like how you can wash either the top rack or the bottom rack for energy efficiency & the bottom rack is big enough for pots or big bowls to fit!",100,"March 22, 2018"
Great Product,We have not had this product very long but I have been amazed of how dry the dishes come out. I pre-wash my dishes so I have not run a very soiled cycle yet.,80,"March 20, 2018"
Great Dishwasher,"I received this dishwasher as a Christmas gift from my mother. After weeks of searching online and looking in stores, this is the one I decided on. It has it all, almost too many options for me, haha. I was use to our 15 year old dishwasher that had very minimal wash options.

The dishwasher gets the dishes extremely clean. I was extremely impressed after the very first wash. I was use to making sure all of the extra food was removed from the dishes with our old washer, no need with this washer. I wanted to test and see how well it washed really dirty dishes, so I loaded it up with plates that had stuck on food and pans that were not washed out. All dishes came out sparking clean, like I said, I was extremely impressed.

I would recommend this washer to anyone.",100,"March 20, 2018"
Great features,Very quiet when operating with nice features and finishes,100,"March 20, 2018"

Third rack very helpful. Cleans all levels well.,"Had this about two months. Noisier than I thought it would be. Installation instructions were awful. Steps weren't in right order, screws were missing, extra parts weren't listed as 'optional'",60,"March 18, 2018"
Quiet,The dishwasher is so quiet and cleans our dishes phenomenally,100,"March 17, 2018"

Quiet and Dependable,Excellent dishwasher. Very quiet and cleans all the dishes well. Lots of extra features and roomy.,100,"March 14, 2018"
Cleans great/Factory Missed Drilling Leveling Hole,"The dishwasher cleans great but one of the 4 leveling screw holes was not drilled into the dishwasher from the factory so my husband had to tap it himself and then screw it in. It was laying in the box so it did leave the factory with someone knowing it was not installed. Only having the dishwasher a month, I really like it. My previous dishwasher quit cleaning and drying so this is very nice. Just disappointed in having to wait until we could get the hole tapped to install the leveling screw. This was a special order dishwasher and it took from December 28 until January 31, 2018 to come in.",80,"March 11, 2018"
Excellent dishwasher!,"Love the features, especially the extra rack above the upper rack used for thin utensils and plastic covers!  Was especially pleased at how quiet it was and what a great job it does getting the dishes clean.",100,"March 11, 2018"
Poor door sealing,"Leaks steam and soap residue at top of door.

No way to lock door shut like last GE dishwasher.",40,"March 10, 2018"
The racks,"I love the dishwasher itself, But the racks are so cheaply made that I have  already broke a piece off.",60,"March 8, 2018"
Functions perfectly,I really like the third shelf for flatware. The stainless steele interior is perfect for my needs. It is quiet and above all it cleans the contents very well.,100,"March 7, 2018"

Great Features,"Love the 3rd rack for silverware. I use the bottom silverware basket for cooking spoons, spatulas, etc. There is much more room in this dishwasher than in my old one. This dishwasher is quiet and does a good job of cleaning the dishes.",100,"March 5, 2018"
Very attractive in looks quietest and just the GE,Love it absolutely the prettiest quietest dishwasher,100,"March 5, 2018"
Like the looks and features,This fits right in with the rest of our GE appliances in the kitchen like the stainless steel interior but maybe should have spent a little more and got the light inside,80,"March 4, 2018"
Extremely Quiet!,I really like this dishwasher mainly because it it so quiet. I had to wait until I went to bed to run my old one because it was so noisy that I couldn’t hear the tv in my den.,100,"March 4, 2018"
Good performance but some fragile components,"This dishwasher functions well, but the installation instructions were a mess and caused complications for me. I was also disappointed to notice the thin plastic components and rope involved in the door assembly, where more durable materials could have been selected.",80,"March 4, 2018"
Awesome,"Love the clean lines,and the smaller rack for knives/large serving ware and OMG it is so quiet!",100,"March 3, 2018"
Quality rich,Just got it installed.  Very quiet.  Loaded with cleaning options.  Top controls make for a clean front.,100,"March 3, 2018"

Great dishwasher but be careful during the install,Got this dishwasher in December in so far is work really well. Very quiet and we like its looks.,100,"February 24, 2018"
"Great dishwasher, but missing parts for install","The dishwasher itself is very good: quiet, efficient, effective, etc. However, when I was doing the installation, I noticed that the screws that were included to mount the dishwasher against the cabinet were the wrong size. This means that the dishwasher isn't affixed to anything and only has the rubber sides holding it in place. Seems like a small issue, but makes a difference and increased the frustration of installation.",80,"February 20, 2018"
Easy to install in minutes,Fist GE Dishwasher and i am very happy .was easy to install and runs so quiet,80,"February 20, 2018"
"Roomy, cleans well, a little noisy",We bought this unit to complement our gas range and microwave. We love the sliding rack on top. Everything is awesome but (and you know what they say about buts) it’s a bit noisy when running. We first thought we had left a tv on in the basement. It has a high pitch frequency but I think we’ve planned our cycles when we are at work or at church. Overall a great unit,80,"February 20, 2018"
Quietest ever!,Love this appliance!  It looks good and does a great job on the dishes.,80,"February 18, 2018"

Great dishwasher,We got this dishwasher a few days ago. Seems like a great product!,100,"February 16, 2018"

Dishwasher,I purchased this dishwasher about 2 months ago.  I am pleased so far.,80,"February 12, 2018"
Love the versatility,"I love that the top shelf lifts up and down, so you can adjust for stemware. The lower shelf also adjusts (my bowls have never before fit in a dishwasher so well!). And the top flatware shelf is great.",100,"February 12, 2018"
Adora,Works very welll.cleans great and very quiet.Easy to use and looks great.Great price too!,100,"February 11, 2018"

Very quiet when it runs,Really like this dishwasher. It's so quiet when it runs that the first few times I used it I had to double check that it was running. Dishes are always clean,80,"February 11, 2018"
So Quiet,I received this dishwasher as a Christmas gift. Best present ever!,100,"February 11, 2018"
Leaks water,"Repair guy will here on Monday. About a month old and a part fell off the door, it leaks water, and the detergent door only opens sometimes.",20,"February 10, 2018"
"Quiet, gets it done.",I’m amazed at how quiet this dishwasher is. Barely know it’s running. And the dishes have come out clean and sparkling.,100,"February 10, 2018"

Great machine!! Very quiet!,Bought this dishwasher because I have a friend that highly recommended it.,100,"February 10, 2018"
Love this Dishwasher,We love three racks. The top rack is for silverware. It's so convenient and hold lots of silverware. Also it's very quiet.,100,"February 7, 2018"
Long cycles,Takes 4 times longer to wash than the one I replaced. Already had to have a repairman out to work on it for low pressure,60,"February 5, 2018"
"So far, fantastic!","I bought my house in 2016 and it came with an older dishwasher which did not have adjustable racks and my dinner plates, which aren't overly large, were too tall for the bottom rack.  Except for not being able to handle my plates, the dishwasher was fine and I didn't consider it overly loud until I replaced it with the Adora.

The Adora is so quite, you really do have to rely on the status light to know that it's running.  Since my kitchen is open to my living room, this is great.  Although I didn't consider my old dishwasher necessarily loud, I did have to adjust the volume of the tv up somewhat if I was running a load while watching tv at the same time.  This is no longer necessary.  I can hear occasional very faint noises which appear to be when the dishwasher is switching between points in the cycle but it is barely noticeable.  It does make my dog growl though!

I love love love the third rack which I use for my utensils and other odd items.  I'm not sure if I'll ever use the utensil basket which came with the dishwasher but I am saving it because one never knows what one might need from time to time.",100,"February 5, 2018"
Not happy,My first dishwasher delivery had missing parts.  I have not had the second dishwasher for a month and it has stopped hear drying.   I'm scared about what will stop working next.,40,"February 4, 2018"
Great features and cleans fantastic,"Have had for 2 months. With previous dishwasher, we rinsed all dishes prior to putting them in the dishwasher. We were really skeptical about how clean they would come. But we love the fact you just load them, no rinsing and they are clean love the 3rd rack feature. Perfect for utensils. Btw soooo quiet too",100,"February 4, 2018"
Sharp looking and super quiet,"So far, so good! Looks super clean and sharp; we use stainless cleaner on it. Love how quiet it is! Had to walk up and put an ear to it and make sure it was running. Happy we spent the extra $ and bought this GE product.",100,"February 4, 2018"
Nice so far,"Easy to load and unload.  Nice features and overall nice dishwasher.  I did not like the trim pieces, they came in three pieces and seemed to be cheap and difficult to install.  Also, when the dishwasher pump kicks on it is loud.  Does run pretty quite for the majority of the cycle.  Overall a nice looking dishwasher with good features.",80,"February 3, 2018"
Quiet and Cleans well!,"Very satisfied with this product. It's spacious, adjustable, quiet and cleans very well!",100,"February 3, 2018"
THE TOP SHELF FOR FLAT UTENSILS,IHAVE A HARD TIME  PLACING THINGS TO FIT PROPERLY.  I WISH A PICTURE GUIDE WOULD BE INCLUDED WITH THE APPLIANCE.  I GUESS I NEED TO GET ON LINE AND SEE IF ONE IS AVAILABLE.  I AM AMAZED AT HOW QUIET IT IS.,80,"February 3, 2018"

Love it!,"This dishwasher is very quiet!  It cleans well on normal setting with good quality dishwashing pods.

"Great Dish Washer, super quiet!!!",We’ve had this dish washer for about a month now and it’s been a great investment/upgrade. The dishes seem much cleaning then they did before and this washer is so much quieter compared to the one it replaced.,100,"January 30, 2018"
I like it but - - -,I like it but it could do a better job of drying.  The plus is that plastics are safer.,80,"January 29, 2018"
Kind of disappointed,"Very quiet, and looks nice.  However, it doesn't do a great job, and it makes a terrible creaking sound when you open the door.",60,"January 29, 2018"
very nice features,"I am pleased and really like this unit so far, very very quiet.",80,"January 29, 2018"
Nice Dishwasher,"I have had this dishwasher since November. It is very quiet but you can hear it running, especially if you are in the kitchen but it is not a loud noise, very suttle.  Love the 3 drawers. We are still learning how to load it.  I do not think it holds quite as much as my old dishwasher and sometimes large bowls or pots are hard to fit, but, nothing to be that concerned about.  I like the top controls and it remembers your last setting.  I would buy again.",80,"January 29, 2018"
So far so good,"The wife purchased this to replace the one in a home we just purchased. It is very quite and efficient. We have had an issue where it will not remove haze from some glasses but...nothing is perfect. She loves the little large utensil drawer located in the top of the dryer and it has taken some getting used to, as she has washed a few utensils 2-3 times. lol 
It is a great bonus with this machine.",100,"January 29, 2018"
"Hard to believe it's working, so quiet!","Installed last Tuesday, 23rd of Jan. Quiet, works well",100,"January 28, 2018"
Great Dishwasher,If you are thinking of this dishwasher get it.  We have had it 3 months now and love it.  I have heard coworkers complaining about their brand X dishwashers not getting the water hot enough.  Not a problem here.  We also love the flush fit installation and the built in towel bar handle.,100,"January 28, 2018"
Very quiet,Looks great still getting used to it large plates sometimes hit each other.,80,"January 28, 2018"
Super quiet and clean!,We’ve had our dishwasher for 2 weeks and can’t say enough great things about it.  It’s so quiet that you can’t even tell it’s running.  It also does a great job cleaning at all levels when filled to the brim!,100,"January 27, 2018"
Quiet,Dishwasher is quiet and gets the dishes clean .  Nice features.,100,"January 27, 2018"
nice machine!,I am very pleased with my new dishwasher.  I have been a GE customer for 44 years and I can count on consistent quality.,40,"January 27, 2018"
Super quiet & efficient!,"This  dishwasher is so quiet I can barely even tell it is on. And with the suggested Finish dishwashing detergent packs the dishes come out sparkling! The only issue I had was that it did not come with a power cord wired on! I had to pay extre to plug it in! Other than that, I am super happy with it!",80,"January 27, 2018"
"Great, Quiet Dishwasher!",We brought this dishwasher for our Lake Condo. We have not been able to use it a lot -- the times we have -- it is great!,100,"January 26, 2018"
Very quiet,I wanted a really quiet dishwasher and got that with the Adora. I like the third rack for knives and other utensils. I have not yet found the best way to load the bottom rack.,80,"January 26, 2018"
Love it,"It’s so quiet you can barely tell it’s running. I love the 3rd rack, it works great for lids and bigger utensils.",100,"January 26, 2018"
SLOW,"Purchased unit in November of 2017. Super quiet but suddenly the grey water wont pump out...and takes 233 minutes (thats what the timer says) to run a cycle on heavy wash...I didn't notice when I bought, but it does not have a rinse cycle??On to the warranty department I go.",40,"January 25, 2018"
I had higher expectation for the diswasher,"have had the dishwasher for close to 3 month now sometimes some of the silverware
still dirty not good for pots unless there already pretty clean.don't dry the cups and glasses that have a slight well in the bottom and plastic I had high expectation of it.
and  have to touch the part of the silverware that's put in your mouth to put in basket
I purchased it because of the third tray and garbage disposal .",80,"January 25, 2018"
No rinse!,I love that with the steam option I don't have to rinse.  Dishes sit in the dishwasher for up to 3 days some out sparkling!!!  So quite I have to check that I turned it on.,100,"January 25, 2018"
Great features. Gets dishes clean,I bought this several months ago and it has exceeded my expectations,100,"January 23, 2018"
great features,Got this just before Christmas.  Love the third rack and how quiet it is,80,"January 23, 2018"
Not bad for the price.,took some time to figure out the operation.  Wish the drying feature worked better.,80,"January 23, 2018"
Best DW ever owned,"Bought the GE Adora dishwasher to match the fridge (which I love).  The dishwasher is amazing, holding twice the dishes the one we replaced.  It is sooo quiet, I sometimes have to check to see if it is on or not.  All dishes and silverware comes out very clean.    Love, love, love this dishwasher.",100,"January 22, 2018"
Adora - DDT595SSJSS,We purchased the dishwasher about a month ago and we like it alot.,80,"January 22, 2018"
Very quiet,Sometimes don't even know it is running when it is.  It does a great job of cleaning the dishes without pre-rinsing. Pretty interior.  3rd rack is nice to have.  Very pleased with product.,100,"January 21, 2018"
Quiet!,Replacing our old dingy dishwasher had been a plan for too long.  We are enjoying the sleek looking GE that allows us to talk while it is cleaning.,100,"January 21, 2018"
Love the top rack,The top rack is great due to we have a lot tops and silverware.,80,"January 21, 2018"
Disappointed,It does not clean well nor does it dry the dishes.,20,"January 21, 2018"
Love this dishwasher.,Very happy with all its features - especially how very quietly it runs.,100,"January 21, 2018"
Love this machine!,"I had my new dish washer installed early December, so I've had it almost 2 months.  It is really quiet, I don't even know when it's running sometimes unless I see the lights indicating that it's running. The dishes come out very clean and dry if I allow the dishes a little extra time after it's finished. It does have a very high pitched ring that you cam occasionally hear if your ears are sensitive enough. I'm very happy with my purchase!",100,"January 20, 2018"
love it,"We purchased this for our new kitchen and I do like it, but sometimes water leaks out at the bottom (not a lot) and sometimes soap scum.  Why would that be?  The door is always shut and locked before we turn it on.",80,"January 20, 2018"
"Awesome, and very easy to use","Bought a new house and decided to buy a new dishwasher,  I just wish we had a new kitchen to go with it!",100,"January 20, 2018"
GREAT LOOKING,JUST BOUGHT THIS UNIT - VERY NICE - works nicely so far,100,"January 20, 2018"
I like the extra features,Especially like the top extra rack for large knives or spatula,100,"January 19, 2018"
So many options!,We've had this dishwasher for about two months and love it. The auto sense option and the ability to choose upper or lower rack for the deepest clean means running the quietest load of dishes I've ever done without having to worry about what the dishes look like when the cycle ends.,100,"January 19, 2018"
"We like it, but...","We have been using this for a few months now.  It cleans our dishes great.  Here is the downside.  The top basket is nice and deep, however the way it is currently designed, all of your glasses fall over unless you wedge something in there to prevent it.  I have looked online to see if there was some sort of product to buy to rectify this problem, but I haven't found one.  We have also noticed that the soap dispenser doesn't always come clean and has plastic residue in it often.",60,"January 19, 2018"
Great so far!,Been using since december and have been very happy. extremely quiet.,100,"January 19, 2018"
Very Quiet,I love that it is so quiet and that you can wash one level or two.,100,"January 18, 2018"
Terrible inside organization,"Inside arrangements to organize plates, bowls etc is terrible.",40,"January 18, 2018"
Super quiet dishwasher,"This was bought as a replacement for an old dishwasher.  The ""assembly"" and putting it in place was super easy.  The only downside was that all four legs are screw in, so leveling was challenging.  It works great though and was a very good purchase.",100,"January 18, 2018"
grea features,"When we moved to our new home, we bought a refrigerator, stove and the dishwasher was not a quality built appliance, so we had to purchase a GE dishwasher to complete the set. Very happy we did.",100,"January 18, 2018"
Great value,I love how I can only wash just the top rack or the bottom rack for light load.,80,"January 17, 2018"
Quiet is the best feature,"Upgrading from a 15 year old dishwasher, a low decibel rating (quiet rating) was what we were looking for.  The color (slate) was a draw as we looked a the GE brand.  I reduce my rating one star because of the lack of a rinse features we had on our older model, quick rinse, 9 minute cycle we used often.  The unit is very quiet.",80,"January 17, 2018"
Quiet,I like our dishwasher because it is so quiet and has lots of space.,100,"January 17, 2018"
Square plates,"Very happy with this product. Quiet and efficient, but if you put square plates in, they catch on the spinning water sprayer if the plate should slip and the corner drops below the basket.",80,"January 17, 2018"
LOVE this midrange appliance,We bought this to replace our decades old dishwasher. This is perfect the 3rd rack for silverware is AMAZING. no touching forks and spoons before putting them away!!,100,"January 17, 2018"
Does great job!,"I am very surprised that this appliance holds so many dishes, and I love the third shelf on top where I can place serving pieces and lids without fear that they will fall through the shelf and hinder the operation of the washer.",100,"January 17, 2018"
Lots of space & quiet!,Love Love Love the new dishwasher! Tons of adjustable space as well as it’s super quiet while washing.,100,"January 17, 2018"
GE Adora dishwasher,I love my new GE Adora dishwasher. It does a thorough job cleaning all items placed in it and is VERY quiet.,100,"January 17, 2018"
Nice addition,I had some issues using liquid soap at first. It would drain down the inside of the door and wouldn’t come off of the dishes. I switched to pods and it fixed that problem. We still have issues with water spots occasionally. The third rack is overrated. The cycle times are quite long but it is pretty quiet and has been working good lately. Not a bad unit. I would buy again.,80,"January 16, 2018"
works great and really like the color,really cleans well  had fully loaded over the holidays and everything was clean,100,"January 16, 2018"
Upgraded,"Our old GE dishwasher died after 15 years of great service so I opted for another GE but this is a fabulous upgrade from the ""builder basic"" model we had. I love the 3 racks. I have so much room that I need to buy more dishes and flatware to fill the washer. Also, it is super quiet so I can run it whenever I want. It's a great product and I hope to enjoy it for many years as well.",100,"January 15, 2018"
Doesn't dry,"I purchased this on Black Friday 2017.  Installers came on time.  At time of purchase, salesperson instructed me to run it immediately in case there was trouble which I thought was odd.  But I've run it about 6 times since then and it does not dry anything.  I followed all the instructions but nada.  So I contacted the installers who came out and within 2 minutes said they don't FIX anything they just check to see if it was installed properly.  Really?  Told me I had to contact GE itself rather than the store I purchased it at.  So that's my next step.   One feature I LOVE is the top shelf pull out for large spoons, stirrers, etc.  If they could just fix the drying issue.",40,"January 14, 2018"
Love this machine,So QUIET! Easy to install. Switched from a very old dishwasher with the center tower to a full bottom rack is wonderful! Dishes are so clean!,100,"January 14, 2018"
Great features,purchased other products very happy and would recommend to friends,100,"January 14, 2018"
"Quiet ,stylish, performance",have used appliance for 1 month thru holiday season. totally satisfied by every metric.,100,"January 13, 2018"
High pitched whine!,Bought a couple months ago. Cleans well but has a high pitched whine on wash cycles. Plan to contact GE or return to store where purchased.,20,"January 13, 2018"
Great Product,"Fast and efficient installation, runs quiet and I love the added feature of the knife and spoon rack on top shelf.",100,"January 13, 2018"
Nice Dishwasher,"I bought this dishwasher a month ago and am very pleased with it.  It is very efficient, cleans the dishes well and is very quiet.",100,"January 12, 2018"
Nice D/W,I have used this D/W for several months and the nicest feature is the layout of the unit along with the super third tray.  It gets the dishes clean!,100,"January 11, 2018"
It's OK!,The stainless steel finish is very hard to keep clean.   smears and smudges and I tried 4 different products plus the vinegar/water solution.  would not buy stainless steel again.  instruction book was vague.  took me a couple of times to figure it all out.  cleans ok.,40,"January 11, 2018"
Great dishwasher!,I love my new dishwasher!  It's quiet and easy to use.,80,"January 11, 2018"
love it,I like the third rack and how quite the dishwasher runs I like the hidden controls and the wash zone select it is built very well,100,"January 11, 2018"
Second Set for Second Home,"During November 2017 I bought a GE Adora set of stainless steel side by side Refrigerator, Gas Range, Dishwasher and Microwave for our second home because we love the similar set we bought a few years ago for our primary home. They are dependable, well designed, easy to use and maintain. I buy the extended warranty ""just in case"" because there are so many electronics in everything a lightning voltage surge might cause damage, but haven't had to use the warranties.",100,"January 11, 2018"
Love my dishwasher!!,"I love my dishwasher.  I love the third row, top shelf for silverware, baby bottle nipples and even spatulas and knives. No more getting stabbed emptying the silverware basket! The top rack being adjustable is wonderful to accommodate tall naglea/Hydro flask/Yetti bottles/cups/tumblers. I can even fit TWO spaghetti pots on the top shelf when its lowered! I have packed this dishwasher as full as i could posibly get it and everythong still came out clean!",80,"January 10, 2018"
Super options,"The quietest machine we have ever had, bar none.Sometimes we question whether or not the thing is working",100,"January 10, 2018"
Excellent dishwasher,"I am so impressed with this dishwasher, we bought offline and absolutely love the 3 racks!!  That was a great surprise I use it every time for all my serving utensils and lids. It is also super quiet, which is amazing!!!",100,"January 10, 2018"
No problems- works as it should,"Checked out a lot of dishwashers before we purchased, including the online reviews. This was highly rated, so we purchased it, and have been highly satisfied. Works great, and looks good with the stainless steel inside and out. No problems at all.",100,"January 10, 2018"
Cleans well & Quiet,We do not need to rinse the dishes and they come out clean. You barely hear it running!,80,"January 10, 2018"
All good except 2 things,"My Wife loves it, it is quite as a mouse. Hose on side should be permanent mount, keeps falling during install, still can't find screws to fit kick plate. It is a Good looking machine and very functional.",80,"January 10, 2018"
Love it.,The 3rd drawer is great for small items that would normally get lost in the dishwasher.,100,"January 10, 2018"
Amazingly quiet.,"Ease of loading, appearance and excellent cleaning.",100,"January 10, 2018"

Great features!,I love this dishwasher!  Three racks and so quiet!,100,"January 10, 2018"
Awesome dishwasher shaved own star off the rating,"The features of the dishwasher, the removable trays, and extra shelf for utensils are excellent. However the danger to the installer due to sharp edges allowed to remain on the sheetmetal frame was a painful experience I won't soon forget. Use of 15/16 hex head feet rather than more common 3/4 or 1 inch size was a particular annoyance. The protective tray beneath the dishwasher with the extremely sharp edges and flimsy tabs that bend easily was also bothersome. It would be nice if the manufacturer of the dishwasher would include a 15/16 socket, a pair of protective gloves, and a first aid kit to aid the installation process. After working through the dangers of installation I found the washer works great. So far I have not found a challenging dish that it could not handle.",80,"January 7, 2018"
"Has great features, very accommodating","I bought this for my kitchen which is exposed to our main family room, it's so quit you barely know it's on. The 3rd rack is great. I love adjusting the height of the 2nd rack. So glad we went this this GE!",100,"January 6, 2018"
Quiet and has great features,"We love this dishwasher and all of its features. It is quiet, does a extremely good job cleaning dishes. Has a good selection of features.",100,"January 4, 2018"

Ultra quiet operation, top controls, 3 tier rack & many more.",100,"January 3, 2018"
Fantastic Quality,We replaced another brand dishwasher that was just over a year old ... the quality of this product is FANTASTIC!!!  I am officially an GE only buyer,100,"January 3, 2018"
All the features and quality I wanted at right $,"This dishwasher had all of the higher end features I wanted at the right price.  I installed myself following the instructions and using the GE approved accessories, and things went perfectly.  The unit is very quiet and functions well.  DIshes come out clean and as dry as I can expect.",100,"January 3, 2018"
Very quiet,Works well and quiet. Looks good. Installation instructions could use improvement,80,"January 2, 2018"
Excellent product,"We have had this new dishwasher for about 6 weeks and we couldn't be happier. It is more efficient than our last dishwasher, our small plates no longer come out dirty, and it is saving us money on our water bill.",100,"January 1, 2018"
Dependable unit,This dishwasher is the quietest one we have ever had. It does a good cleaning job but I still have to pre-scrape the dishes. I used to use light wash on my old one but on this one I have to use regular wash. Overall just fine.,80,"January 1, 2018"
So quiet and dishes are clean sqeecky clean,I have a GE dishwasher it is awesome. so quiet. I can stand right next to it and hardley hear it run.,100,"December 31, 2017"

Works great,Works great!  Easy to set and use.  Like the easy to change filter,100,"December 31, 2017"
Love being able to do 1/2 loads,"This unit was installed about 10 days ago and we've loved using it and it cleans very well. I just scheduled service for it, however, as it started leaking this evening. I requested service online, which was very easy to do and someone is scheduled to come out in three days (its over the holidays.) I look forward to using it again once it's not leaking!",80,"December 30, 2017"
Love all the features,"I really love the product and all the features.  Would like to suggest making a place just for over sized Utinsils like spatulas, spoons, etc. used to cook with, and on top rack a row especially for bowls from china set!",100,"December 29, 2017"
Quiet and efficient!,We bought this dishwasher after researching online to find the best priced and reviewed model.  We're exceedingly pleased with the efficiency and quietness of this dishwasher.  I like to use the time delay to start a load after we've gone to bed or work.,100,"December 29, 2017"
So far the best dishwasher i’ve Ever owned,This is the second GE dishwasher we own.  It is quite and we really love the new silverware tray at the top.  I would recommend it to anyone,100,"December 29, 2017"
It's a really good dishwasher,5 star dishwasher My wife love's this dishwasher  Uses it every day,100,"December 28, 2017"
Nice quality!,This is the quietest nicest looking dishwasher I've ever owned. It cleans fantastic but the racks spacing is a little disappointing.,80,"December 28, 2017"
Excellent washer. Never dissapoints.,Never leaves any of my dishes dirty. They all come out brand new. Great product.,100,"December 27, 2017"
Nice update to my old dishwasher,Love the top rack for knives and more delicate utensils.  Dries the dishes better than any model I have used ion the past ten years.  Highly recommend!,100,"December 26, 2017"
Ok dishwasher,"cleans well but doesn't dry dishes completely.  also, wine glasses are too tall to fit on the top rack which is annoying.",60,"December 26, 2017"
Clean and dry,"Our previous dishwasher provided reasonably clean and dry dishes, but this dishwasher really cleans and dries.",100,"December 26, 2017"
Super quite. Difficult installation,"The installation was extremely difficult. Took my husband over 4 hours and an extra trip to the hardware store for additional part's. The directions were unclear and difficult to follow. Side strips were useless and had to be pulled off to complete installation. Leveling the machine was difficult to adjust hard to gain access once 
machine was in place. Overall the machine is extremely quite and washes all my dishes thoroughly. Hoping this will be the last time I have to purchase a new dishwasher for a good long while!",60,"December 25, 2017"
Great features,We got it a few months ago and we are so happy with it,100,"December 25, 2017"
Love everything about it!,"It is so quiet. Very fashionable looking, easy to use, logs of room inside.  Only downside is it takes a long time for cycles, but the dishes look amazing! Would rather it takes a while and does a thorough job.",100,"December 24, 2017"
Great Dishwasher,"Bought this dishwasher about a month ago, it was installed last week.  It was worth the wait.

So far so good.",100,"December 23, 2017"
Don't even know it's running!,"never had a dishwasher this quiet. Great features, if half full u can run top or bottom only.",100,"December 23, 2017"
Nice dishwasher!,"It is thoughtfully designed, quiet, and washes dishes well.",100,"December 23, 2017"
Great,I like the three shelves and it cleans great. It is so quite I have to turn everything off to hear the dishwasher going.,100,"December 23, 2017"
perfect,"I knew I would love everything about this washer, quiet, clean looking, works great!",100,"December 23, 2017"
Love the size!,"The inside is huge-holds so much, and I love the adjustable rack. The third row is great, too. I have had more stuck-on food left on dishes than with my old, 18 year old dishwasher. There’s also a high pitched hum during part of the cycle. Those two things would probably keep me from recommending this dishwasher.",60,"December 23, 2017"
Great Dishwasher,I have never had a new dishwasher and I have always had to wash my dishes before putting them in the dishwasher. Now I can just put the dishes in the dishwasher after scrapping the extra food off and they come out so clean. We love tea and our tea pitchers have been stained even with me scrubbing them clean. After putting them in this dishwasher they came out looking brand new again. Also this dishwasher is so quite I have to be careful not to open it after my husband has started because you can’t hear it running like our old dishwasher.,100,"December 23, 2017"
Excellent,I bought this a couple of months ago really quiet and does a amazing job on cleaning,100,"December 23, 2017"
Great dishwasher very quiet,"Replaces broken dishwasher. Works great very quiet. Dishes come out sparkling. The run time is a little longer than old unit.

Very satisfied with purchase.",100,"December 22, 2017"
Great features,"We bought these items in Nov. 2017, and we are very happy with them.",100,"December 22, 2017"
Very Happy,Bought this machine as a replacement. Very happy with the quiet operation. Dishes are coming out squeaky lean. Only criticism is that it’s very hard to see the function selection if the lighting isn’t “correct” in the room around you.  I do have to move the door up and down until it’s just right.,80,"December 20, 2017"
"It's not silent, but I can use it during the day","Very large capacity than my 15 year old model.  It takes a long time to clean, but clean it does well.  Pretty quite during most of the cycle, but there are times during the 174 minute cycle that you hear it kick in and fill and drain.  Worth it though.  If if had $200 more dollars at the time, I'd go for a better one for sure.  The best part is the upper rack.",100,"December 19, 2017"
Quiet and powerful,So quiet I have to try and hear it and even then it is hard to.   Cleaned dishes beautifully,100,"December 18, 2017"
So quiet and clean.,We love it already. So quiet and efficient. A beautiful upgrade to our home.,100,"December 18, 2017"
So Quiet!,We are loving how quiet this dishwasher is! Our old dishwasher we could hear from another room in the house. This one is so quiet it was great!,100,"December 18, 2017"
So quiet!,"I have had my dishwasher for nearly 2 months now and I couldn't be happier! It is so quiet you don't even know it's running. The dishes come out sparkling clean, even without a pre rinse in the sink.",100,"December 17, 2017"
Love this dishwasher!,"I have only had this product for about 5 weeks but I can tell you it works terrific so far. Gets the dishes much cleaner than my old machine, and is honestly so whisper quiet I cannot even tell when it's running without checking the color of the light (I have older children who fill and run the dishwasher, otherwise I would know it's running if I started it myself obviously). We are a homeschooling family of 8 who is home all day so we run the dishwasher every single day. I love the 3rd loading shelf up top where we can put things like cooking utensils, etc. I also love that the main spot for utensils is not in the door, I hate that design on many other dishwashers. The entire inside is SS, and the racks are coated very nicely. It's a beautiful, well functioning machine!",100,"December 17, 2017"
"Works well, good rpice",We've had this dishwasher for two weeks now.  Washes dishes great with minimal rinsing (we only get the large chunks off so the filter stays free of debris).  Very happy so far.,100,"December 16, 2017"
Quiet!,Love the slate color and it is so quiet you don't even kmnow it's running.,100,"December 15, 2017"
Great Dishwasher!,I love this dishwasher! It cleans all the dishes really well and I love all the features. I can get everything in it with ease. It is so quiet you don't hear it running. Definitely recommend this product.,100,"December 15, 2017"

"Very quiet, good washer",Bought it a month ago does a great job fits well in the kitchen sytle,100,"December 13, 2017"
So far so good,This dishwasher is very quiet.  Luckily there is a light that tells us that the machine is running.  Dishes come out clean and dry.  The cycle takes some time but I understand this to be true of most energy efficient dishwashers.  This machine replaces our old GE dishwasher that was 18 yrs. old.,100,"December 13, 2017"
Great product,"Super quiet, dishes are super clean, love the style and options!",100,"December 13, 2017"
The Quietest Dishwasher I have ever had!,"I have had cheap dishwashers and expensive dishwashers and this is the quietest one I have ever had, it not any louder than my microwave. I remove the silverware basket from the bottom tray so I have more room for dishes and only use the third top tray for all my silverware, very happy so far!",100,"December 12, 2017"
DDT595SSJ2SS,"Very nice Diswasher built very well. Holiday magnets also stick on it that’s a plus. Bought the stainless style/look. Also the silence of this dishwasher is impressive we can only hear it when the water is entering the sink drain when Your actually listening. Top mini rack is a great plus. Zone wash is very useful, pick the rack you want to only wash or all of them. Top basket uses bearing.....thank the maker how nice and easy to slide in and out. Overall great choice. GE did Right with this model.",80,"December 11, 2017"
I'm in love,"I am absolutely in love with this dishwasher!  Easy installation, super quiet running and makes a pleasant, soft chime when it's done.   No complaints whatsoever.",100,"December 11, 2017"
It's okay,"Takes a long time to dry, and some items don't get dry
Leaves rust spots on knives
So many options that I can't understand them all",60,"December 11, 2017"
Cheesy/Bad,"Takes way too long to wash, went bad within a week. Wouldn't want it for free in future.",20,"December 10, 2017"
So happy with this one,"Bought this to replace a young dishwasher of another popular brand. I'm so happy we did. It's quieter, and seems to wash better. The controls make sense, the door is sturdy, and I love the third rack for extra utensils.",100,"December 10, 2017"
"So far, so good.","Although the delivery and installation process was a nightmare. I love the look of the dishwasher and it works well so far. I really like the 3rd rack. The 1st time I used it, dishes were still wet, wated was pooled in spoons; but I set it to heated dry & it worked better. Settings are intuitive & easy to use.",80,"December 10, 2017"
Very Quiet!,"I can nearly hear it running, which is nice for a dishwasher.

It has a good capacity, with the 3rd shelf and no spout in the middle of the bottom tray.

It matches the refrigerator, microwave and (Pfister) matching faucet we got a year ago.

The only slight negative is the larger capacity meant a taller door that means a tighter passage between the open dishwasher and the island.",80,"December 10, 2017"
Love Color,works great. Very easy to install. Came with all parts to connect,100,"December 9, 2017"
SO QUIET YOU CANNOT HEAR IT RUNNING,PURCHASED IN BUNDLE IT LOOKS GREAT AND WORKS GREAT,100,"December 9, 2017"
Extremely quiet diaswasher,this product is extremely quiet. the new color is very nice. only run a few times but seems to do the job very well.,100,"December 9, 2017"
another happy customer,This new dish washer is AMAZING!! It is so quiet you cannot even tell its running standing next to it.  I also like the 3rd shelf my pizza stone fits perfect and has never been so clean.  Very impressed thank you GE!,100,"December 8, 2017"
Looks great,"It has only been installed for a week but so far we are pleased.  It's so quiet , I love that . I really love having the top drawer, I was disappointed that it's plastic, and not the same material as the other racks.  Oh and the holes in the flatware baskets are too big and the handles on our spoons and forks keep falling out so we just put them on the top rack. Overall I do love it",80,"December 8, 2017"
Cleans great and very quiet,Dishes come out spotless and is very quiet. Would recommend.,100,"December 6, 2017"
"So far, so good","I have only had this dishwasher a couple of weeks.  It is really quiet.  You can hear it if you are in the kitchen and the tv is not on but just barely.  I can hear my tv without turning the sound up really loud like I had to do with my previous dishwasher.  I like the 3rd shelf for knives, spatulas, etc.  I am still learning the settings and the correct way to stack.  The only things that has had water left on them were the top of a few coffee cups and a couple of plastic lids.  Just a few things have not came out spotless but I did not soak them before I washed them so no really an issue.  I would recommend.",100,"December 5, 2017"
Very quite!  Cleans beautifully and great options.,Excellent product.  Very quite when operating.  Cleans excellently and has wonderful options such as sanitizing which is most helpful when household person has illness.,100,"December 5, 2017"

Great Cleaning Power Without Noise,"I replaced a 12 year old dishwasher looking for something much quieter.  This has fit the bill nicely.  It is barely audible while the tv is on.  The 3rd rack for small items and silverware is fantastic, saving space in the bottom drawer for larger pots and pans.  I am very pleased with this model.",100,"December 4, 2017"
"Quiet, Thorough",I have had installed for a couple of months and I love it.,100,"December 4, 2017"

Love this dishwasher,"Our dishwasher was delivered and installed 2 days ago. I am amazed at how quiet it is compared to my old one. It is so quiet that you cannot tell if it is running!. So far, so good. Seems to do a great job. We bought the slate model and it looks wonderful in my kitchen with white cabinets.",100,"November 26, 2017"
Worth the investment,I bought the dishwasher a month ago. After I realized the plug wasn’t removed and was the culprit for the dishwasher not draining no more problems!!!  I do wish it had an option for just a rinse cycle. Holds lots of dishes comfortably. Great option,100,"November 26, 2017"
Outstanding dishwasher!!,Cleans even better than advertised .  My dishes and silverware sparkle...mo matter what they look lole.pripr.to.starting the cucle...love it.lotz!!,100,"November 26, 2017"

Jury Is Still Out - AND It's Early,"I have owned this dishwasher for 1 day. Ordered it in slate - and it is beautiful. The unit was professionally installed, however it did not drain. I called the store where I bought it (since it has only been 24 hours) and they scheduled a service appointment for the next business day (although it's Friday, so not until Monday). I'm a little concerned that right out of the box this did not work as it should. Hopefully the service call will resolve the issue - or perhaps I have a lemon.",20,"November 17, 2017"
Runs Wonderful and so super quiet,This dishwasher not only cleans better than any I have had before it runs so quietly you have no idea it is even on,100,"November 16, 2017"
Very quiet!,We wanted a dishwasher that was quiet and this GE Dishwasher exceeded my expectations.  Hardly tell it's running.,100,"November 16, 2017"
One of the best!!,We bought our dishwasher 2 months ago. We absolutely love it!! The features are fabulous and we love the top rack for utensils and stuff,100,"November 15, 2017"
Sweet Dishwasher,This dishwasher is easy on the eyes and is quiet  The best part it hasn’t leaked.,100,"November 13, 2017"
Unusable from the start,"Upon installation it would not work, still attempting to resolve.",20,"November 12, 2017"
Quiet!,"Purchased 4 months ago and absolutely love this machine.  It is so quiet we don't even know it is cleaning.  It sits adjacent to the family room and does not interfere with anything we are doing (ie. Watching tv, visiting with family, etc.)  It also does a great job cleaning.  Flushes out the coffee and tea stains in our mugs.  Baked on food is no match to this machine.  Plus it has a useful shelf inside to wash utensils and small items that tend to get lost or end up in bottom of washer.  I definitely recommend this dishwasher.",100,"November 12, 2017"
Neat features,I'm a big fan of the top tray for large utensils and the drop down feature for the glassware rack.,100,"November 12, 2017"

Dishwasher,I picked it up only yesterday so I'm still unsure.,80,"November 11, 2017"
"Super Quiet, Great Features & Very Clean Dishes!","This dishwasher exceeded all our expectations. Super quiet, adjustable middle rack and top silverware rack rack are improvements over our last dishwasher. Our previous GE dishwasher lasted 14+ years and would still probably be working today if the pump had not failed due to a water supply problem (the water was inadvertently shut off at source while it was running - not the dishwashers fault) Brand name was an important factor in choosing our replacement dishwasher. Also like the sleek look and hidden , top mounted controls that are out of sight of the grand kids inquisitive fingers!",100,"November 11, 2017"
Love this dishwasher!,Bought this dishwasher about 2 months ago and I've been really impressed with how clean it get a my dishes.  It's also quiet.,100,"November 10, 2017"
Love my machine!,"The noise of my old machine, along with it not cleaning so well anymore no matter how much my husband  worked on,  is why we purchased a new one.  This model had a lot of features I hadn't considered (third upper rack) and it cleans and dries wonderfully on the energy efficient mode, but the best feature is how quiet it is.  You can't hear it unless you're next to it.  After having to wait to turn on my old machine either before bed or when getting ready to leave for work, its a joy to use.  The outside finish is easy to keep clean too.",100,"November 10, 2017"
Top inside controls nice touch,Just installed very quiet has side flaps that block any opening between cabinet and dishwasher. Love the handle for opening and closing. This is the quietest dishwasher so far very pleased,80,"November 10, 2017"
Love the slide out utensil shelf! Cleans great!,I love everything about this dishwasher! Love the inside shelves.,100,"November 8, 2017"
New dishwasher,This product is great so far! No problems at all! My only gripe is when the other reviews said there was little room underneath to hook up plumbing and adjust feet they meant it! It is really tight and hard to move around under there. Just a little advice.,80,"November 6, 2017"
nice looking dishwasher inside and out,"it washed my dishes, especially glass ware the shine was amazing
still need to figure out the best way to put certain dishes into get the best of the cleaning 
the third rack for utensila is great

the con on this washer-no quick cycle
and for some reason there is always water left in the dishwasher on certain dishware, not thoroughly  dry 
that is a concern to me",80,"November 6, 2017"
Quiet and clean,Was looking for a good but quiet dishwasher. This one fit the bill and then some.  The first time I used it I had to double check that it was working.  It was that quiet.  The dishes are clean and that's what matters most. The super quiet opera ty ion is a bonus.,100,"November 6, 2017"
Love this dishwasher,"I love the top rack for spatulas & large spoons, although i feel the rack could be a little lower from the top to fit a larger item. Great cleaning & it actually dries my dishes!",100,"November 5, 2017"
Quiet!,"Very quiet while operating. Nice looking front panel.  Tray arrangement is good, skinny top tray for flat items is handy.",80,"November 5, 2017"
Great features and looks awesome,"Very quiet, very efficient.. Glean well, so much room for larger plates and dishes, with a top row for silver wear that can be removed so, the second row can be raised and lowered easily..  Very pleased, chose black and the ulcer looks wonderful in my white  kitchen..",100,"November 4, 2017"
features,"I bought the Adora Slate set when they first came out.  I love the color.  I was not happy with the dishwasher.  It had issues with the soap dispenser, that was a few years ago.  So, to buy this set again for our new home, I was hesitant.  I was informed that GE had made changes since and I am happy to say they corrected the problem .  So far no issues with the dishwasher.  So happy it has been fixed.  A beautiful set to any kitchen!",100,"November 3, 2017"
Dishwasher never worked.,"Out of the box, this dishwasher did not work. Parts were backordered for at least 3 weeks",20,"November 3, 2017"

Works perfectly,"I've been using my new dishwasher for a few months now. No complaint at all. Cleans well, it's quiet, and the top rack (third rack) is awesome for longer utensils like tongs and spatulas. Great product.",100,"November 1, 2017"
Quiet dishwasher,I bought this  a month ago and it is unbelievable quiet! I like the hidden controls and various 2,100,"October 31, 2017"
Very quiet!,"We bought this dishwasher about 2 months ago.  It is so quiet you don't even know when it's running.  Also, lots of room inside for taller items.  The 3rd rack at the top is handy for knives, spatulas, small cups, measuring spoons.",100,"October 28, 2017"
Great Features & quiet,"I'm so happy with this dishwasher we purchased a month ago. Best features  are you can do just the top load or just the bottom load, it is so quiet & does a great job!",100,"October 28, 2017"
Does a great job,Seems to do a really good job other than the start button has to be pressed very hard in order for the dishwasher to start.,80,"October 28, 2017"
It does what the advertisement state.,"I purchased this month, very easy to install. Very quiet operations.",100,"October 27, 2017"
Better than our old Maytag,"This product is considerably quieter, has a greater capacity, and more washing features.",80,"October 27, 2017"
Dishwasher,I like the quietness. Also the top drawer is handy,100,"October 27, 2017"
Great products,"Very quiet, easy to operate.  Fits as advertised per dimensions.  Easy to see green light when load is done and yellow when running... necessary due to the quietness.  Cycles seee long, but dishes are clean.",100,"October 26, 2017"
Not what I expected,"The top rack is really tight, we already have stains from the soap, we have opened the door to the soap canister not opening to fully clean dishes and even when it opens are dishes are really dirty.",40,"October 24, 2017"
Cleans like no other,I am very happy how quiet it is as well as how functional it is.,100,"October 23, 2017"
Quiet but,It is very quiet. I still have not mastered how to turn it off so none of the lights are lit.,80,"October 23, 2017"
Very Happy!,Purchased for a rental property.  Product is a great value for the money.,100,"October 22, 2017"
We are happy,So far we have been happy with our purchase. the dishwasher is quieter than we thought. It has done a good job at cleaning the dishes. It also dries well. We are getting used to the silverware tray and the silverware cleans very good.,80,"October 22, 2017"
great features,Was a gift and very pleased with quiet operation and clealiliness of dishes,80,"October 22, 2017"

Sleek design,This is a great dishwasher with great features and it's the quietest one I've ever owned.,100,"October 21, 2017"
great features,I am so impressed with how quiet the machine is.  I can run it and still watch TV at the same time--no interference.  It does a good job cleaning.,100,"October 21, 2017"
Pleased so far!!,Bought 1 1/2 months ago and so far has performed well....old one was 12 years old.,80,"October 19, 2017"
Very Nice,Very quite - love the handle on the door over the other recessed handle,100,"October 16, 2017"
Adora dishwasher,"I just bought this and installed. First run through did not add jet dry rinse aid and dishes were not dry and inside was all wet. Second time running added jet dry rinse aid and dishes were dry, as well as inside was dry this time. Very quiet machine",80,"October 15, 2017"
Great Value,"All the bells and whistles at a fair price. We have rentals, so I have installed at least 20 dishwashers. First Tall Tub dishwasher I ever installed. They are tough to install because the extra tub height = less working room underneath to level and make connections. And the protection pan underneath is a real pain to install as are the black plastic tub trim pieces. Also, it is about twice as heavy as a low price dishwasher. So, if you are not an experienced dishwasher installer, I recommend paying for the installation. The install comments also go for any tall tub dishwasher, so that is not a minus to this one. It works great, is very quiet, and it actually cleans the dishes without a pre-rinse in the sink. Nice!",100,"October 14, 2017"
VERY QUIET!,I just bought this and I'm impressed with all the options and how quiet it is.  It looks awesome as well.,100,"October 13, 2017"

I ABSOLUTELY LOVE MY NEW DISHWASHER,"I have had my new GE Adora dishwasher for abt 2 mos. It replaced a 14 yr old GE Dishwasher that was in the house when we bought it. The new one is not only BEAUTIFUL, but SO QUIET!!! You have to check to make sure its on! Its bigger and holds more and the Stainless Steel interior is great! Dishes sparkle and are dry when the cycle is finished. Didnt know what I was missing!!",100,"October 12, 2017"
Super quiet!,Great looking and super quiet.  It does a great job!,100,"October 12, 2017"
Amazing!!!!!!,Easy to use/ works great!  Definitely the best dishwasher I have ever purchased.,100,"October 11, 2017"
Great Quality,This  appliance was installed today. Pretty easy hook up. Works great and seems to do an incredible job!,100,"October 11, 2017"

Sleek and Quiet,"I’m very pleased with this purchase. Not only is the dishwasher an attractive addition to my kitchen, it’s also really quiet. I’ve accidentally opened it a few times because I didn’t realize it was running.",100,"October 7, 2017"
So quiet,Very happy so far with this purchase. We have had the dishwasher for about a month. It is quiet and we like the 3rd rack feature.,100,"October 6, 2017"
Dishwasher,"Super quiet and efficient, however it does not drain well and has an odor inside",60,"October 6, 2017"
Great look and matches other GE appliances,I just had this installed(excellent job) my othe GE appliances match even thought they are Profile not Ahora but because of the handle wife wanted this model to match. Ran it a couple time and it was quiet and very efficient.,80,"October 5, 2017"
Quiet and Efficient,This dishwasher is extremely quiet and cleans the dishes very well.  The third shelf is wonderful for silverware and other flat objects.  I would recommend this appliance to anyone in the market for a dishwasher.,100,"October 3, 2017"
Quiet,We bought it two months ago. Really like dish washer. Very quiet.,100,"October 1, 2017"
Dishes are extremely clean!,"We needed a new dishwasher, and wanted one that was quiet and had the third rack.  This dishwasher was one of two that had fhose features.  The prices were fairly comparable.  Installation was easy, we followed the directions.  The third (top) rack is easy to load, we line up the flatware, and are able to lay our sharp knives in the center area of the rack.  There is plenty of room for glassware in the second rack, and everything else fits on the bottom rack.  The dishes sparkle! We love this quiet cleaning machine!",100,"October 1, 2017"
Good but drainage pronlrm,"We love this dishwasher,   the only issue is it doesn't drain. completely every 4th time.",80,"September 30, 2017"
Great Machine,I was surprise how quiet it is.  You do not even notice that it is even running. Wonderful at cleaning.,100,"September 30, 2017"
Great dishwasher,"After looking at many different dishwashers that had the option of a 3rd rack I finally settled on this one. It has everything I wanted, including tons of space, extremely quiet, efficient, customizable and it was a great price for what you get. Only down side that I have seen is that the dishes on the top racks do not always dry very well, but simply adding the jet dry does the trick. Dishes always come out clean without any water spots or dried on food, even when using the lowest setting. My guests are always shocked when they come over and I tell them the dishwasher is running because it is so quiet! Being able to adjust the second rack has come in handy much more often then I would have thought as there are so many dishes that are of different sizes. Some can only go on the top rack, so giving it more space to fit them is awesome and so simple.",100,"September 29, 2017"
New Dishwasher! Yay!,This was just installed yesterday. Already have run 2 loads of dishes. The water temperature gets piping hot. My glassware came out spotless. No food left on any of my dishes. The 3rd top rack is my all time favorite part of this dishwasher. What a brilliant idea.,100,"September 27, 2017"
"Great features, little to no noisy",We purchased ours about 6 months ago and it's been wonderful. The 3 racks are really helpful and super functional. I'm amazed on how little noisy it creates. I makes sense why there's a light to let you know its running.,100,"September 26, 2017"
Great o,"Honestly bought this because we were replacing all of the appliances in our kitchen and it was the brand/color that went along with everything.  I love this dishwasher.  It is so quiet, cleans and dries great.  I love the upper silverware drawer that I hardly use the baskets when on my old machine the racks would always be full.  The only issue I have is the space between the top silverware rack and the top rack.  I can't lower it without it running into my dishes on the bottom and some glasses/mugs run into the top or turned on their side.  Overall though it's a great dishwasher.",80,"September 25, 2017"
Quiet!!!!!,"Very quiet when in use.  Same features as more expensive models .  Front stainless panel seems like it could dent easy.  Feels like soft pad or just air beneath it. So it may flex or dent if a guest pushed gard or used knee to close.  But everything seems like this now, not as heavy exterior finish as old days.",100,"September 25, 2017"
Great features,I bought this a month ago and it does everything except load the dishes,100,"September 23, 2017"
Great dishwasher,"This is the best dishwasher I have owned.  It has great features and, best of all, it's quite.",100,"September 23, 2017"
Quiet and effective!,"We have an open great room - kitchen area, and the new dishwasher is so quiet, you would hardly know its running. Now the TV doesn't have to be turned up to drown out the noise. Yeah, GE",100,"September 23, 2017"
Very Quiet,Replaced old dishwasher. This one is much quieter and does the dishes twice as good as the last dishwasher. Only thing I don't like is that it seems to take a long time to do a load of dishes.,100,"September 23, 2017"
Great features and quiet,I bought this dishwasher 2 months ago and am so happy with it.  The top rack is the best idea - keeps things in place and cleans very well.  I love the Slate finish and design.,100,"September 22, 2017"
Great product.,"Very quite, I have to check to see if it's running.",100,"September 21, 2017"
Poorly designed,"Poorly designed both the controls and rack. My previous dishwasher I had for 24 years , I replaced it because it started to get noisy, and felt it was time. It had one source of control, you selected Full Wash & Dry, or just Rinse or Dry. Total time for full Wash and Dry was 60 Minutes, This new washer is 123 Mins, and  the inside of the washer is still WET. The interior rack is poorly designed especially when you use the TOP Rack. I replaced the silverware rack with my old one. The knives with the new rack you had to be very careful on how you placed them in the rack as they leaned over to the right and you couldn't close the washer. We just previously purchased a new GE Stove and were thoroughly satisfied with it. But this Washer leaves a lot to be desired.",20,"September 21, 2017"
Love the stainless steel interior.,Dishes come out clean as a whistle. Only problem is the heated dry cycle doesn't work well. I don't know if it's the stainless steel interior or not. But it is always very damp to actually wet when finished.,60,"September 21, 2017"
SO QUIET,"We Love our Adora dishwasher. It is so quiet.  If you didn't see the special light on door, you wouldn't know it was running! Also glad we got the model with the third rack for silverware. It is so convenient.",100,"September 20, 2017"
Works Great!,"We have used our new dishwasher several times, and it works great!  So far we are very pleased with our purchase!",100,"September 19, 2017"
Best dishwasher I've ever had.,"I've had problems with dish washers over the years.  This one cleans very well, and is so quiet that you can barely hear it.  The extra drawer for cooking utensils is a big plus.  With the extended warranty, it should last a long time.  Very happy with this appliance.",100,"September 18, 2017"
Quiet and practical,"I bought this to replace a home builder grade, horrible looking, and loud dishwasher. Loved the SS interior and the 3rd shelf for silverware.  It is so quiet the only thing I hear is the water emptying into the drain.",100,"September 16, 2017"
Disapponted,"I really like the looks of this dishwasher BUT I am extremely disappointed in the performance!  The dishes are very wet even after using the heated dry option and keeping the door shut for hours (even overnight), to the point that I am hand drying the majority of the dishes.  The running time is way too long and depending on the cycle chosen can be 3 hours!  The bottom rack is hard to get dinner plates and bowls to stack good.  I am very upset with the fact that I waited so long to get this dishwasher and that it wasn't a cheap model either!",40,"September 14, 2017"
Very quiet,"Very happy with this washer!  It is so quiet I never hear it running.  It does a fantastic job cleaning and is very spacious.  Two things I don't like: 1. you can't tell where in the cycle the washer is, and 2. I run it at night because it takes a very long time for the drying cycle.",80,"September 14, 2017"
"Nice, but ------","We bought this a few weeks ago because our dishwasher, which was nearly 25 years old, quit working.
So quiet, I love that, as the old one was extremely noisy.  Like the hidden controls.  Do miss the prongs on the sides to hold glasses.  And I have tried various kinds of dish washer detergent & continue to have occasional dirty dishes.",80,"September 13, 2017"
Great product!,This dishwasher is very quiet! Really like the stainless steel look.,100,"September 13, 2017"
Works Great,I bought this about a month ago and so far have had no issues.  Very quite while working.,80,"September 11, 2017"
Awesome Cleaning Power!,We bought this to replace our old dishwasher. Right away my dishes were getting much cleaner. When it's on and cleaning you can't tell. It is extremely quiet. Soooo glad we bought it.,100,"September 11, 2017"
My Dishes and Glasses SPARKLE!,I am very happy with this Dishwasher. I am using the same dishwashing products and getting much better results. It does not seem to run longer but it cleans noticeably better. So happy I choose it.,100,"September 10, 2017"
"Good dishwasher, some minor improvements needed","I like this dishwasher, it's quiet, spacious and I like the zone washing option. However, there are some minor improvements that I think would make this an excellent product. The cycles are very long, if you want the dishes to be cleaned well--even after rinsing. Also it goes through rinse aid much faster than my last dishwasher. Lastly, the utensil basket melted just from regular use after 2 months.",60,"September 10, 2017"
Junk,Sorry I bought this dishwasher. Should never have bought it!!!,20,"September 9, 2017"
Great features!,Love how quiet it is and the  fact there are 3 racks.,100,"September 9, 2017"
Amazing! So happy I purchased this!!!,"Purchased this dishwasher to go with the Adora series refrigerator, stove and microwave. I could not be happier with my purchase! I love all the extra features like the third tray on the very top, it makes for a perfect spot to wash everything from my infants bottle tops to my knives. Another fantastic feature is the ability to move the top rack for the cups up or down. This for me was huge because my husband has HUGE water cups that don't fit in other dishwashers we have had and putting them on the bottom rack ruined them before. I am absolutely thrilled with my purchase and would HIGHLY recommend!!!",100,"September 9, 2017"
Love it,"Really like the features of this dishwasher,  very quiet and does a great job.",100,"September 8, 2017"
Quietness,I love the look and the way it clean the dishes. I also love that it is quiet.,100,"September 6, 2017"
Hugh tub,"Love the stainless steel tub, and extra rack. I'm going to enjoy this quiet machine!",100,"September 5, 2017"
Cleans great but doesn't dry well,Cleans very well but doesn't dry completely. Looks very nice in stainless.,60,"September 4, 2017"
Well made!,Great product. well made. Super quiet!! Highly recommend!,100,"September 4, 2017"
Very quiet dishwasher,We have had this dishwasher a little over a month now. It replaced another GE dishwasher that was put in by the previous property owner and did not match the other appliances in the kitchen. The dishwasher is very quiet and cleans dishes really good. I don't know if its running unless the front light is on. The old dishwasher was so loud we never ran it if we were going to bed.,100,"September 3, 2017"
Looks and works beautifully,It is huge and I love the top shelf.  Cleans beautifully and is nice and quiet.,100,"September 3, 2017"
A few problems...,"I want to like this one more but the racks are iffy and don't close correctly all the time. You can't remove the upper rack in order to fix the slider mechanisms that are always getting out of alignment. You have to contact a repair person to come out to address the rack so a big pain in the backside.
If you go more than two days without running the unit it starts to smell badly. I believe this is because water is always present in the cavity under the filters in the bottom of the dishwasher. Why it doesn't drain completely is a mystery to me.
On the good side, it cleans OK and runs quietly.",60,"September 2, 2017"
GE dishwasher / Azora. Model from Home Depot,"Runs quiet, cleans well, great value and well built",100,"September 1, 2017"
Great product,"Given to me as a gift! Awesome machine, I will spread the word.",100,"September 1, 2017"
Great features very quiet running,Bought dishwasher about 3 months ago and very happy so far. Runs very quiet.,100,"September 1, 2017"
Love it all!,This is just what I needed to keep up with 6 kids!,100,"September 1, 2017"
Poorly built,Looks like a well built appliance but it is not- cheap and flimsy racks and hardware,20,"September 1, 2017"
Great features!,"I love the third row option! It's great for utensils and flatter objects.  The adjustable rack is great for taller items.  Sound is minimal, and I absolutely love every feature.",100,"August 31, 2017"
Nice looking and lots of features.,Overall it's a good dishwasher. Only time will tell about the longevity. The only problem I have is the length of time it takes to do the dishes. If you turn on all the features it can take up to four hours to do a load of dishes. Normal time without drying is 75 minutes if you add drying it's 123 minutes.,80,"August 30, 2017"
Awesome Dishwasher,"Our old dishwasher was 15 years old.  We replaced it with this GE and AMAZING.  It is so quiet, you can barely tell it is running.  The dishes come out very clean, and I can stack many more dishes in this unit.  Thrilled with our purchase!",100,"August 28, 2017"
fantastic dishwasher,"This is the best dishwasher I have ever owned. It is quiet, cleans well and has great features.",100,"August 27, 2017"
Super appliance.,Plenty of room for lots of dishes and silverware. Love the top third rack for my knives. Very quiet while running!,100,"August 27, 2017"
GREAT PRODUCT,"We decided to update our dishwasher when the old one died.  So glad we did this dishwasher looks wonderful and it is so quiet, you cannot hear it running. It matches our other GE appliances.  We try to buy made in America whenever we can.",100,"August 25, 2017"
Standard Dishwasher,"I bought this a couple months ago thinking it would work better than my 20 year old dishwasher that came with the house.  Our water is very hard, so I think now that might have been the problem all along.  However, our old one was broken at the bottom and this one isn't, so it's still an improvement.  It's a decent dishwasher that cleans fairly well most of the time. It would be good if the utensils had their own jet as those tend to not get as clean as everything else.  Great for the price though!",80,"August 24, 2017"
Nice dishwasher!,I really like the utensil tray in the top and the ability to washer by section.  Very quiet operation.,100,"August 21, 2017"
Love this dishwasher,It is VERY quiet and does a great job cleaning. Very happy with this purschase,100,"August 17, 2017"
So Quiet You'll Think its Not Working!,"Our kitchen and family/living room are separated by a breakfast bar.  Under the counter and built into the bar is the dishwasher.  When our hold dishwasher was running, it was difficult to have a conversation or watch television because of the noise - almost 70 decibels (yes, we downloaded an app and measured it).  

This new appliance won't even register noise on the same app while running.  The ONLY time we hear any noise is when it is draining.

That's not even the best part!  The adjustable top rack allows us to put full plates and bowls for washing AND there is a secret third top shelf to put all those large, awkward shaped items like chopping and carving knives, spatulas and serving spoons.  

We are very happy with our purchase and now don't need to be concerned about when we are running the dishwasher because we can't hear it.",100,"August 17, 2017"
Great Features,Love the adjustable racks and the top rack is great for big utensils.,100,"August 17, 2017"
Very Quiet,Have used this dishwasher twice and it cleans well and is very quiet. My wife and I installed the dishwasher ourselves. We feel the instructions were at times a little vague and hard to follow. We think that pictures of each step would be a great help for the homeowner intaller. The dishwasher does fit well and looks and works good once installation is complete. Hoping for many years of clean dishes from our first GE appliance.,100,"August 9, 2017"
black interior,Not happy with the black interior--it is hard to see where to put items. Did not know the handle would stick out so far==now we have to open the dishwasher door to get the drawer on the opposite side to open all the way.,80,"August 9, 2017"
Nice dishwasher,"This dishwasher is very quit.  It cleans dishes at high qualit. My only complaint is the finger prints. I clean need them off, then put car wax on.  Wala gone.",100,"August 9, 2017"
LOVE IT!,my 6yr old dishwasher died so we upgraded to the Adora.  I really like how solid it feels.  I wanted something that felt like it would last.  it is super easy to use. it does a great job cleaning the dishes,100,"August 7, 2017"
Great features,Received this as a birthday present from my brother.  Can't believe how quiet it is!  Didn't think I'd like the 3rd rack but it's great.  No more spots on my silverware!,100,"August 7, 2017"
It is very nice,I bought it for my wife she loves it and uses it all the time,100,"August 7, 2017"

Works and looks great!,"Love this dishwasher,  it's really a good looking machine and does the job well. Only thing is it seems to run a while,  but as long as it cleans thdm good its ok!",100,"August 6, 2017"
Sleek & Stylish,Love this dishwasher! It provided all the benefits we were looking for and so happy it came with the third rack for silverware. Very happy with the purchase!,100,"August 2, 2017"

Looks Sleek and Quiet,I received this appliance on 7/23/17. I love the controls being hidden and its has a lot of loading space. Once I used it for the first time I could not even hear it running. VERY QUIET.,100,"July 29, 2017"

Great Product easy installation!,Always liked and had good experiences and the durability of GE appliances.,100,"July 26, 2017"
Best Dishwasher I Have Ever Owned,"I had to replace a dishwasher and decided to try GE appliances.  I liked this model because it had a 3rd rack and an option where I could wash just an individual rack, if necessary.  I have owned it a year now and have absolutely no complaints.  Dishes are cleaner than I ever before from other brands.  The unit is quiet when washing.  And, for the first time, I do not need to wash the dishes before washing the dishes.",100,"July 26, 2017"
Drain Pump Loud,Installed on 7/24/2017. Just ran a cycle with no dishes an the pump to drain seemed to be loud and also kicked on and off a lot.,80,"July 25, 2017"
So Quiet!,Have had six previous dishwashers.  None have performed as well as the Adora.  This is the most quiet dishwasher I have ever had.,100,"July 24, 2017"
Great Dishwasher!,We bought this dishwasher and absolutely love it! We love our third pull our drawer for our bigger utilities. Definitely recommend!,100,"July 23, 2017"
Great Dishwasher,This dishwasher works very well. I love the fact that I can was just the bottom rack or top rack alone. The third rack is a very useful feature. Easy to load and does a tremendous job cleaning dishes.,100,"July 23, 2017"
Great Dishwasher,"I bought this several weeks ago and so far it has met and exceeded my expectations for cleaning, quietness and ability to load bowls and other odd shaped objects and ability to move tines on bottom rack and adjust top rack. Also really like the third shelf at top for utensils etc. Only thing I would change so far is location of silverware basket. Wish I didn't have to open door all the way and roll out bottom rack to put silverware in it. But over we are very impressed with this dishwasher.",100,"July 21, 2017"
"Quiet operation, cleans great","Surprised by how quiet it is and love the 3rd rack for long spoons, etc.  Would have liked to had a rinse and hold feature though.",100,"July 20, 2017"
Love all the options,"Adjustable racks, hidden upper rack, wash cycles for individual racks and super quiet.  So happy with this purchase!",100,"July 20, 2017"
Really quiet,I like the dishwasher my one complaint is it takes 3 hours to complete a cycle,80,"July 19, 2017"
Doesn't Dry,"I have only it  used once to make sure it works since it was only installed yesterday, but the dishes were soaking wet when it was finished ( and I let sit for several hours after finishing). I am hoping that I just didn't do something right. I am going to read the book and will post differently if things change",20,"July 19, 2017"
Sleek Look - Super Quiet,I just bought this dishwasher and am amazed at how quiet it is and how clean my dishes come out. The sleek look is an added bonus that makes my kitchen look great and updated,100,"July 18, 2017"
Very quiet!,I bought this to have a stainless dishwasher.. it has three racks which I love! And the hidden buttons are nice with the kiddos.  Also very very quiet...,100,"July 16, 2017"
So Quiet and effective!!!!,"We bought the Adora dishwasher because it has a 3rd rack for knives and large utensils. But it has surpassed our expectations! It is so quiet you have to look to see if the light is on to be sure it is running, and my kids think I have super ears. It cleans wonderfully, I love the lids on the utensil baskets as a way to keep the flatware from sticking together. The exterior design is veey thoughtful as well. The control panel is hidden when closed and the handle makes for secure opening and closing.",100,"July 16, 2017"
Love the color.,Upgraded apliances. Loved the additional features offered in this one!,100,"July 15, 2017"
Amazingly quiet!,We've had this dishwasher for a few days. So far it cleans really well and we love the 3rd drawer. It is astonishing how quiet it is.,100,"July 10, 2017"

Best dishwasher on the market,"We tried a different brand simply because it had a 10 yr warranty.  After going through two different washers we tried the GE, should have done so in the first place.  The quality and features are out standing for the price.  I love the machine and will always buy GE from now on.",100,"July 6, 2017"
Runs quiet as a mouse!,"I'm very pleased with this dishwasher.  Love the stainless steel interior, oppose to plastic.The only downfall is it takes a long time to wash dishes. Overall I give this product a 4.5 out of 5.",100,"July 4, 2017"

Fantastic,So far so good! Love the 3rd rack and how quiet it is when it runs!! I am in love!,100,"July 1, 2017"
Awesome dishwasher!,"Purchased Sunday, delivered Friday, installed it myself (took 2 hrs), and ran first set of dishes through it. Unbelievably quiet, had to ask my wife if the thing was really running. Went to a wedding, came back 3 hrs later and the dishes were blistering hot, dry, and squeaky clean. I mean, there are some glasses we did not put in our old dishwasher because they came out streaked. And we had to rinse before putting them in. I told my wife not to rinse day old dishes, just stick them and one of the special glasses too. The glass came out beautifully.

I gave 4 stars because the install process following the manual was not exactly spot on. I am not an expert installer, but I have replaced our garbage disposal and installed a new microwave (not for faint of heart!) But both have been working just fine for over a year or so, so thought installing the dishwasher can't be that hard. I removed the old dishwasher, so I had a fair idea what it would take. But some of the diagrams and written instructions took a bit of mental interpreting, so if you are not mechanically oriented, have an installer do it. Probably could do it in 1 hr or less, but at least I know how it came together. Useful knowledge for future! 

The appliance itself is great, got the stainless steel look which is really nice. Got a spray solution the salesman recommended to minimize fingerprints, and the front shines! Not regretting the purchase of this model!",80,"July 1, 2017"
Great,I just bought a week ago so far so good. I just love the upper tray. Extremely quiet. great price,80,"June 27, 2017"

This dishwasher is very quiet in like the hidden c,This dishwasher is very quiet has lots of room and love the hidden controls,100,"June 18, 2017"
Silent!,The one thing that you I love is that this dishwasher is whisper silent. It also has a third rack on top that proves beneficial for odd items. I'm extremely happy with this purchase.,100,"June 17, 2017"
Love it!!,"I have had this dishwasher for a couple months now.   It is the quietest dishwasher I have ever heard!  I love the 3rd rack feature!   Gets the dishes very clean, and a lot drier than my previous dishwasher.  Absolutely recommend! Very good price also.",100,"June 17, 2017"
great buy,"I love that it is practically soundless, and the slate mode is so easy to clean without leaving smudges.",100,"June 17, 2017"
Happy,So quiet!!!! And LOVE the third tray. Very happy with this purchase!!,100,"June 15, 2017"
Does clean well,"We bought all 4 new appliances of GE in Stainless Steel. The actual dishwasher does a very good job of cleaning the dishes and for the cycle we select most of the time. It's not an outrageous time amount. ($$$ saver!!!) So, why you buy a dishwasher for, it's great and does a fine job. However, we got Stainless Steel, bad move. None of the SS we got are fingerprint resistant. Why GE??? I cannot recommend this color at all. I'm cleaning the front and top 4x a day it get's so dirty with water drips. The handle is well placed for opening but not cleaning. Good luck if you buy the same color.",80,"June 12, 2017"
So quiet!,Ive only had this dishwasher for one week but so far i am so happy with it. I dont have to prewash my dishes anymore and i am so happy about that. It is also extremely quiet. You can hardly hear it at all. Big thumbs up!,100,"June 11, 2017"

Very good features!,"The Adora is so quiet that we had to make sure it was working.  The flexible racks inside make loading dishes very easy.  To top it off, it is made in the US!",100,"June 3, 2017"

Great dishwasher,"Our dishes and glasses are not only clean, they shine. This dishwasher is extremely quiet and easy to operate. We are very happy with this purchase.",100,"May 26, 2017"
CLEANS MY DISHES!!,I was using cheap competitor brand that I basically had to wash the dishes before dishwashing the dishes to ensure cleanliness. Not any more! I am so happy I purchased this brand.,100,"May 25, 2017"
Great features& very quiet,I have had it about 5 weeks and used it almost daily. It dries better if you fill the rinse aid dispenser. I really like the silverware rack with individual slots and the third rack on top for long utensils and other low profile pieces,100,"May 24, 2017"
