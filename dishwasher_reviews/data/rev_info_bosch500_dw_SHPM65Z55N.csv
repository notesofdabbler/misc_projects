Amazing !,"I researched every known dishwasher on the market and kept coming back to Bosch. I needed something quiet so I didn't have to turn my tv up in the next room or wait til my kids were awake to not risk waking them up. After installation I was eager to put a load on . I read all instructions and used recommended cleaner . Turned it on and waiting patiently . I immediately panicked and thought it was broken or malfunctioning . It wasn't making any noise !!! I re read the instructions and noticed it said if the red light was shining on the floor then it was on and working . Sure enough if I leaned my ear in super close , I could hear a tiny amount of noise ! Wow! That's quiet . My dishes came out cleaner than I ever imagined ! So happy I went with this model !

Amazingly dishwasher,"Absolutely love this stylish thought out  dishwasher.  It is so extremely quiet.  It does an amazing job cleaning.

Massive upgrade from our old one!,Works great! No longer dread opening the washer to see how dirty everything still is after a cycle. The auto air feature is great. Very happy with the purchase so far! [This review was collected as part of a promotion.],100,"October 16, 2020"
Problem with lower rack,A little worried about loading lower rack which falls ofc track and hard to re-align / lift when full of dishes. Seems to wash ok so don’t want to pay for a service call. Also has a bend in side and funny smell after washing.,80,"October 2, 2020"
Best Dishwasher by Far,"Loved the design and quietness of the machine, we made and thoughtful design specially the three layers with the top layer where you can placed small and big items that don't fit into the side utensil tray. I'd strongly recommend the machine for those who want to update or looking for a new dishwasher! [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]",100,"September 24, 2020"
Bosch 500 Series Dishwasher,"Thanks goodness Bosch has a light to tell you the dishwasher is running - without it you would never know!

My wife and I definitely recommend! [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]",100,"September 22, 2020"
"It will be nice, If Bosch has smart functionality","I love Bosch dishwasher. Due to COVID 19, major retailers stores that sell  Bosch dishwashers were out of stock. It took me 3 months; finally, I got the Bosch 500. The installation is simple. During the wash cycle, the machine is quiet, perform well.  I am sure I will buy Bosch dishwasher in future as needed. Only one suggestion for now , I hope Bosch design team consider to add smart functionality design. Therefore, users do not need to press too many buttons in order to make it run.

Best dishwasher ever!!!,"I bought this dishwasher 2 months ago and I'm so impressed with the quality and the performance. My dishes have never been so clean and it's so quite that thanks to the red light it has at the bottom, you can tell it's running. I'm so glad I've decided to go with this brand.

BREATH OF FRESH AIR,We purchased this dishwasher after a warranty fiasco with a different brand name dishwasher.  I wish we would have purchased this Bosch dishwasher in the first place.  It is wonderful! Everything comes clean with a sparkly finish!  My daughter ( picture attached) especially loves it because she no longer has to do the dishes by hand!  Thank you Bosch for a great dishwasher!! [This review was collected as part of a promotion.],100,"September 8, 2020"
Love our Bosch dishwasher,"We got a Bosch dishwasher because it was top rated in consumer reports and they offered a rebate for the installation.  It was a great decision.  The quality of the materials is exceptional.  Even the inside of the unit is stainless steel. It is very, very quiet and easy to use.  We really like the adjustable shelves and the flat top shelf that we can put spatulas and big spoons on for cleaning.  The cleaning is exceptional. I have used a white plastic coffee cup for years. (I know but, I have 5 of them.  They are thick and oversized.  I've had them for probably 15 or 20 years).  Anyway, they are white and even though I clean them they have stains on the plastic. Without doing anything different, other that getting the Bosch, the inside of the cups are clean. I didn't think it was possible.  
  The Bosch dishwasher is everything you would want in a dishwasher.  Quality made, adjustable shelves, very quite, works exceptionally and made in the USA. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]",100,"August 30, 2020"
Amazing Dishwasher - you'll love this one!,"The Bosch 500 Series Dishwasher is amazing! Cleans all dishes, glasses, and utensils with amazing shine and is oh so quiet - you don't even know it's on! Thank goodness for the ""floor light"" as seen on the bottom right of this photo - it lets us know when it's on and running through cycles. We love the Auto Air feature, that pops the door open automatically at the end of they cycle to help drying. This dishwasher with the versatile third top rack helps us add so much more to this dishwasher, better than our former older Whirlpool model ever allowed us to. You won't be disappointed - sleek design, and amazing quality! [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]",100,"August 27, 2020"

Best Dishwasher Ever!,"We've purchased dishwashers over the years and, no matter how good the reviews, we were always disappointed. This time, we thought perhaps it was a good time to look at a Bosch dishwasher, but we were concerned it would be out of our price range. We did our research and decided that the Bosch offered so much more for only slightly more than some competitors. The quality of materials, the features, how quiet it is & the cleaning of our dishes, glasses,  & silverware was 100% better than any of our previous brands! Now we tell anyone who's looking for a new dishwasher not to consider any brand other than Bosch! [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]",100,"August 10, 2020"
Paint Problems,"This dishwasher is a significant upgrade from our old one. Dishes are really clean and dry and the dishwasher is very quiet.

It is so QUIET! We replaced a GE appliance and the difference is amazing. I was worried about the dishes getting dry as this has no heating element but it does a great job. I know you can get less expensive dishwashers but you get what you pay for. I would recommend.",100,"August 4, 2020"
Clean and Quiet,"We absolutely LOVE this dishwasher,  we had it installed in our old house and used it for over a year before we sold the house. We missed how quiet it was, how clean our dishes were and most of all the utensil (third pullout tray).  So when our dishwasher started leaking in our new house we looked no further and immediately purchased the same Bosch brand. We love the new air dry feature and of course happy to have the red light on our floor (it's the only way to know the dishwasher is on) [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]",100,"July 29, 2020"

Super quiet with great features,"I was confused initially by the controls and couldn't find instructions to help.  I did figure-out what I needed to know and have had no problems, since.  One feather we like very much is that it is super quiet.  Space utilization is very good.  We especially like the top rack used mainly for silverware.  Very convenient.  The wash is thorough and dishes are dry enough even though there is no heating element in the wash compartment.  We typically use it in the evening and dishes have all night to dry.  The red light on the floor as helpful.  When it's a steady red, we know it's still working, and when it's blinking, we know it's finished.  Lots of different control options.  We don't use most of them, but the ones we want are there.  Good quality washer.  And, the service and warranty features are excellent.  We would buy it again.",80,"July 24, 2020"
Flawless installation and operation,We love this dishwasher! We have done a kitchen remodel and changed 5 appliances. This was the only one that went in without something going wrong. Installation was very professional and quick. The installers even corrected a previous contractor's work without complaint. It has been working flawlessly since. We love how it is so quiet that you can't tell if it is running unless you see the red light on the floor. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.],100,"July 17, 2020"
The good and the bad (mostly good),"After a couple of month's use, here's where I'm at with it:

Pros
- Quiet. This was a factor in my purchase.
- Red LED light projected onto floor. If it weren't for the red LED spot on the floor, I often would not know it's running. 
- Seems to clean OK in the lower and middle racks.
- The feature to pop-open the door after the cycle is complete is nice. It was a selling feature since I've heard that Bosch dishwashers do not dry very well. 
- Adjustable dish and glass support tines and features. So far I fold most of these out of the way, but I know they are there if needed.
- Center rack height can be adjusted to three different heights. 
- Top silverware rack has adjustable tines and outer sections, and can be removed to fit taller items in the middle rack.
- The soap dispenser fits the Kirkland-brand detergent packets.
- Easy to DIY install. The instructions are good.

Cons
- Does not dry as well as my prior 17 year old washer. I think the feature that pops the door open helps. I was under the impression that these dishwashers use heat for drying, but there is no visible heating element in the bottom. Conversely, the fact that there is no heating element in the bottom probably means that plastics can be washed on the bottom rack. The only issue I've had with plastic in the bottom rack is that the jets are so strong that the plastic storage container flipped over.
- Spacing of the dish support tines is awkward. The plate tines are so close together that only plates and thin items can be used there. Thin baking pans (1"" deep sheet pans) do not fit. The tines in the space for larger items are not aligned on the left and right sides, even when the optional tines are folded down, meaning that you cannot fit quarter-sheet pans across some sections. At best I can get three to fit, spaced farther apart than necessary, yet not far enough to fit something else between.
- This model does not have the two-piece utensil basket. I think Bosch should include the two-piece utensil basket with all models (why inventory an extra item?), but especially with all models that have the flatware rack. I only ever need part of the utensil basket and the two-piece basket would allow me to reclaim some bottom-rack space for dishes.

Would I recommend this? Yes. However I suggest considering models with better drying, better tine arrangements, time-remaining display projected onto the floor, and the two-piece utensil basket.",80,"July 11, 2020"
Clean as a whistle,"My dishes have never,ever been cleaner ! I will always recommend Bosch dishwashers, definitely worth the money. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]",100,"July 5, 2020"
Dry clean dishes everytime!,I spent a lot of time researching dishwashers and Bosch clearly came out #1 for reliability.  I selected this 800 series dishwasher for the AutoAir drying option and my dishes dry better than they did with my old KitchenAid with a heat coil.  I do live in northern Nevada so I live in a dry climate so maybe the drying problems noted in reviews were written by people who live in rally humid climates.  I was going to replace the long silverware basket with a smaller one but found that all our utensils fit in the flexible 3rd rack.  By removing the silverware basket it freed up space for more dishes which was needed since these European designs don’t seem to accommodate as many dishes as American designs. It’s a big plus being able to put plastic anywhere in the dishwasher. I turn my very quiet 42dBA dishwasher on every night before I go to bed and wake up to clean dry dishes. Plus it’s a great looking appliance.  I highly recommend buying the SHPM65Z55N/01.,100,"June 24, 2020"
Quietly Tackles the Dirty Dishes,"This is my first Bosch dishwasher.   I had several other brands in the past.   Wow, what a difference.  

First, I no longer have to ""pre-wash"" my dishes.   They go from the table right into the dishwasher.   I have yet to see any food that this dishwasher cannot handle.

Second, it is the quietest dishwasher I have ever owned.   If it did not have the red laser light projected on the floor, I would not know it was on.

Third, the rack adjustability, took a few minutes to figure out, but now it's so simple and easy to adjust the racks to tackle any size pan or dish.

Fourth, I did the install myself.   The directions were super easy to follow.  The dish washer comes with a standard plug, but you can also order a hard wiring kit if needed.  It took less than 45 minutes, start to finish.

I am glad I followed the other reviews and chose this Bosch Dishwasher.   I highly recommend it. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]",100,"June 15, 2020"
Even happier with the 2nd one!,"We bought a Bosch dishwasher at our previous house several years ago, and when we moved into this house in 2014, I swore I'd get around to swapping out the old dishwasher with a new Bosch unit.  Finally got around to it last month and it's every bit as good as I remembered.  Super efficient, super quiet and does a great job. Very well-designed machine.  Well worth every penny!

Great dishwasher,"Best dishwasher I have ever owned! It is so quiet you really need to have that little light shining on the floor so that you know it is running. What impressed me the most was that it cleans peanut butter off of knives without any rinsing at all!  The only reason I gave it four and not five stars is that if you use the uppermost, third tray for utensils and spatulas and such, you are not able to put stemmed wine glasses in the upper tray as there was not enough clearance  regardless I love how you adjust the rack.  Certainly not a deal-breaker and we are very pleased with the machine",80,"May 26, 2020"
Perfect Buy!,Remodeled the kitchen and bought a Bosch 500 dishwasher. Excellent choose!! It is so quiet that you can not tell it is even running. The dishes come out sparkling clean.

DW’s Review,Quality product very quiet does a great job getting our dishes clean. I do believe this is one of the best dishwashing units on the market for the value. The one area that needs improvement in my opinion is the programming of the options on the dishwasher. Setting up the options needs to be more self intuitive right now I had to pull out the owners manual to fully understand how to program the options that I wanted to utilize for the dishwasher. I do believe once boss spends a little time and makes the option programming more self intuitive that this will be one of the top selling units in the industry. The feature we like most is the auto air the auto air option really does get the dishes dry as we typically like to see with some of the new energy efficiency rules that are in place we feel this option is a must and that's why I feel like what I do about the programming.

Fantastic Dishwasher,"This is simply the best dishwasher I've ever owned.  My dishes are sparkling and some items that I thought were permanently stained are now completely clean and like new.

Exceedingly Satisfied,"When we bought our current house in 2011 the flipper installed a base model Whirlpool dishwasher that lacked everything. Decent rack space, decent rack alignment, the ability to clean dishes without a prewash, the ability to wash itself, or the ability to properly hold half my dishware was lacking.  Also, when it ran we might as well have lived by the airport.  I finally gave up and washed most of my dishes by hand.  I researched dishwashers and settled on Bosch and got this particular model and am amazed.  The racks, the configurability, the efficiency blew me away, and we now have to go into the kitchen if we can't remember if we turned on the dishwasher because it is so quiet.  Anyone trying to take it away will have to pry it from my cold, dead hands. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]",100,"April 24, 2020"

I like the Air Dry feature with the new energy efficiency requirements for dishwashers it really is needed otherwise dishes always come out too wet. I would recommend Bosch take a play out of the Apple hand book and make their programming of the options more self intuitive.

Disappointed,"We had a Airman's dishwasher for almost 20 years. It just stopped working.  It would have cost about $500 to fix it, so we decided to buy a new one. Bought the 500 series which on paper was similar to the one we had.  SOOO MUCH LOUDER.  My other dishwasher, you NEVER heard.   This one you don't need the red light, you know it's running.  This one is so cheaply made.  The door is flimsy, for the $$, I will not by another one.   The air feature is a cool idea, but dishes are still wet",60,"March 28, 2020"

Clever design,"We love this dishwasher.  There were several features that we thought were gimmicky when we bought it, but it got such good reviews for being quiet that we didn't care.  We were wrong about all of those features.

The utensil basket is amazing.  It has dozens of spots for silverware.  Way more than our family of four can fill in one load.  After a few uses of the dishwasher, I realized I hadn't had to clean any spoons after the dishwasher ran.  You know how there's always a spoon that has junk on it when you're putting the silverware away, well not in this dishwasher.

We also thought the third rack wouldn't be terribly useful.  Again, wrong!  It's great.  It fits all of our long utensils, except the ladle.  Very helpful and great if you have a party.  We love this dishwasher. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]",100,"March 13, 2020"
Nothing a cheaper dishwasher would not do better,"Gave up a cheap builder’s grade GE for this but would gladly go back to my cheap one. There is no room to put anything.

It's been a month and I couldn't be happier with our Bosch dishwasher. We are truly amazed at how quiet it is! So quiet, when we first ran it we thought it wasn't working. I do suggest you use the products they recommend. They are a little pricier, but even your baked on casserole dish will come out clean. Also, read and follow the manual regarding how to load and use your settings. Sounds silly, but it's important. All dishwashers are not the same.

Always have enjoyed bosh products.,"As a carpenter I've alway enjoyed the quality of bosh tools. So it was a no brainer picking bosh for our dishwaher. Easy to install. The One thing about that was it has a plug in cord, so I had to put in an electrical box. 
The dishwasher does have a slight smell to it after you run a load not sure what it is if it's the plastic from the trays, I thought it was like a new car smell that would eventually go away, but still has not. 
It does get the dishes sparkling clean and saves my hands from getting dried out.

Wonderful!,"My old Kitchen Aid dishwasher stopped working 2 days before Thanksgiving after 19 years of faithful service. With family and friends coming over for dinner on Thanksgiving I was a bit panicked to say the least. I tried to get the old dishwasher repaired but they no longer made the circuit board. Fortunately the repair man said if I found a dishwasher he could install it on Wednesday, the day before Thanksgiving. I asked him which brand he would buy and he replied ""Bosch"". After checking the local stores I found one and brought it home. After installation, I must say this thing runs like a dream. While my old Kitchen Aid was very reliable and did a fine job, it was loud. The Bosch is so quiet you can hardly tell if it's on. The dishes come out spotless and I love its versatility. The shelves are also very easy to adjust. Large wine glasses are no problem and the third rack is a nice bonus. If it lasts anywhere as long as my last dishwasher I'll have to say I bought a winner!

Great Dishwasher - Super Quiet!,"I'm really loving my Bosch dishwasher. I had one at my prior home but I was a little hesitant with this purchase because I read a few poor reviews. I'm so glad I decided to go with Bosch. It offers all the features I need - speed wash, half load, auto, heavy, normal, delicate and sanitize. It says ""silence plus"" and at 44 dBA I don't even hear it running. I love the red light that reflects on the floor that tells me when the load is finished. It's a quality product and I believe it's superior to anything else on the market. My dishes are dry and spotless every time!

Fantastic dishwasher,This dishwasher gets the dishes cleaner than clean I cannot believe how clean it gets them also it is so quiet that they had to put a red light on it to shine on the floor so you know it's running and on top of that it actually pops the door open after the dishes are done to help them dry I couldn't be more satisfied with this dishwasher I highly recommend it to anybody needing a new dishwasher you cannot go wrong with this one this is definitely is a winner [This review was collected as part of a promotion.],100,"October 3, 2019"

This Bosch checks all the boxes for me. Let me start by saying I use to prewashing my dishes before placing them in the dishwasher. With this Bosch it is not necessary to do so. There are several options for loading dishes and everything normally placed inside, usually places large plates on the lower rack has adjustable tines that fold or slide to allow multiple options depending on what is being washed. The middle rack is height adjustable to allow taller stem ware to fit if desired and help maximize space. The 3rd upper rack is a great feature as works well for large cooking utensils like tongs, spatulas, measuring cups, cutlery and flatware. At the rated 44 decible rating this dishwasher is extremely quiet and need to be right next to it to hear it in operation. There is a red light that shines down on the floor to let you know its status. There are lots of options for different washing cycles ranging from a quick rinse to heavy which will clean baked-on pots, pans and dishes. I normally put the cycle on ""Auto"" and let the dishwasher determine how long the wash cycle should be. I do use Finish Jet-Dry for a rinsing agent and it helps dry everything including plastics. Overall, I am extremely impressed by the Bosch 500 series dishwasher and look forward to years of terrific performance.",100,"August 16, 2019"
The Bosch 500 Series Top Control Tall Tub Bar Handle Dishwasher in Stainless Steel with Stainless...,"The Bosch 500 Series Top Control Tall Tub Bar Handle Dishwasher in Stainless Steel with Stainless Steel Tub, AutoAir, 44dBA is an outstanding dishwasher. In our neighborhood social media app someone asked for dishwasher recommendations. Nearly all of the recommendations were ""Buy a Bosch."" And they are as good as you've heard. Installation was not complicated but required cutting a new hole in the sink cabinet for the supply and drain lines. They have to be placed as per the directions. The machine is pretty much a complete block with little unoccupied space. The unit is perhaps 2mm or 3mm taller that the unit being replaced. Since the previous homeowner installed a thick stone floor cover I had to temporarily raise the counter 2mm or 3mm to insert the Bosch. Once in place the counter was placed back where it was and the everything was secure. There are some mounting tabs on each side that worked but not as described in the installation instructions. In the end the only items I needed to acquire was a dishwasher supply hose (mine included the 90 deg adapter from 3/8 braided to a 3/4 male hose) as well an electrical for a new outlet. The unit being replaced was direct wired while the Bosch has a power cord with a three prong plug. 

After installation a dishwasher has to clean dishes well, do it quietly, be easy to use and look good. This Bosch aces all of those. The first several loads of dishes were a concern because an oily film seemed to form on the inside of the door. A switch in detergents seems to have solve that problem. The unit has washing programs from easy to clean to tough baked on. They all do an excellent job. This Bosch is very quiet. When our old unit was running a conversation in the kitchen was not possible. Even watching TV in the living room was tough. Not with this Bosch. It is the quietest dishwasher we have ever owned. We can run it anytime without worrying about the noise. The touch selections on the top of the door are easy to use. While there are a number of washing options to choose from, we generally just go with the Auto cycle with has a food sensing feature. We like the time remaining indicator. This unit has an AutoAir Dry feature which opens the door ajar once the cycle is over. That enhances drying and lets fresh air in. That is a neat feature when you can't be there when the cycle is done. Lastly, the Bosch 500 series is stainless steel with a clean look the fits perfectly with our other kitchen appliances. 

This Bosch has an enormous number of features that we are learning to use. Great dishwasher!",100,"August 5, 2019"

The installation went well. I have installed a lot of dishwashers. Things are finally getting easier. This machine has the water supply and electrical on the back side. That means you don’t have to reach through jagged metal edges and manipulate tools with the tips of your fingers. The bottom of the machine he’s a built in catch pan for any water that may leak and turns off water to avoid a flood and a insurance claim. The leg adjustment is much easier. The front are easy to access. The rear leg adjustment is a thousand times easier than the old system. All you need is a straight screw driver and turn till level. After an easy install, time to run this thing. l was a little disappointed with the drying of the dishes. I called customer support, they explained a condensation drying system. Meaning, hot water washes and heats the dishes. The steam that comes off the dishes condenses on the stainless tub. Allowing the warm dishes to dry. They also explained choosing the sanitizer and auto air option which pops open the door at end of cycle allowing moisture to escape. Due to epa and energy restrictions, the have to do the job with less. It helped reaching out and getting information from the source.",100,"August 3, 2019"

Whisper quiet, without the indicator light, you would never realize it is on. So many very positive, easy to use, engineered design features, that to describe them all would require a book. Adjustable trays... not the traditional two drawer, but three drawers with a top rack for cutlery. Easy top door controls, easy slide detergent dispensers, for liquid and jet dry, or pods, or tablets. My favorite feature was easily the end of cycle door opening, to stop the condensation, and leave every item dry. A wonderful, and well made, designed, and intuitive machine.

The interior is well laid out, though I found the third top rack more of an annoyance and removed it. The machine is so quiet I had to put my ear against it to make sure it was running.

This is by far one of the quietest dishwashers on the market. It is so quiet that a red spotlight is built in to project on your floor to let you know the dishwasher is operating. The convenience of a third shelf for silver and small items like ramekins provides adequate space without taking up room on the two other racks. All items washed in the dishwasher come out sparkling clean. I use the recommended pods and rinse liquid to enhance the cleanliness of the content. The accompanying instruction book provides all the information needed to use the control panel on top of the door.

,"Best dishwasher upgrade yet, hands down! Our old dishwasher had done a pretty good job, but often times some items still had to be hand cleaned. The new Bosch stainless steel was as functional as it was beautiful. Having the controls on the door top also keeps the little ones out of mischief when my sons family comes over. It does a wonderful job the first time and everything comes out completely clean. The new innovations were also a pleasant surprise, requiring the GFCI connection and a direct plug in, instead of removing a metal box and having to hard wire. No doubt, this will get a lot of use.",100,"July 24, 2019"

The bottom rack is nearly impossible to pull in /out smoothly when its loaded (works great when empty) and hard to get to sit evenly on the supports to run the load - if it falls crooked, it blocks the lower rotating water source so the dishes don't get cleaned.

Mostly love this dishwasher,This dishwasher cleans dishes like no other. I'm very happy with the power of this machine! Using the sanitize mode and jet dry helps get most of the dishes dry (except for plastics). I do love the option of putting larger plastics on the bottom rack without worrying about them melting.

It's supposed to be finger print resistanct but I am constantly cleaning the front of the washer. Another small annoyance is the silverware rack.

This Bosch dishwasher exceeded my expectations.  It is incredibly quiet, you don’t even know it’s running.  They improved the drying mechanism, this was one complaint with my old one is that it did not always completely dry the dishes.  This Bosch dishwasher has numerous features.  I particularly like the half load wash feature and the delay feature.  I will keep buying Bosch because they are very reliable.  My only complaint was Home Depot’s delivery and installation company.  The delivery company they used brought the machine without the installation kit I bought and then I had to wait an extra four days to have them install it.  The person that did the installation did not read the installation manual an did not loop the drain line correctly, did not level the machine, rested the machine on the kick panel and told me that the two screw holes in the panel did not line up so it did not need to be screwed in with the two screws that were supplied.  He also did not find the vapor recovery gasket on the back of the machine that was supplied to be installed between the counter and the machine so now there is a gap there.

You will have to be very strategic in loading it - I completely understand people's complaints that you can't load as much.  Also, we do notice a slight difference in cleanliness if you don't use a rinse aid.  We've had ours for a month, and no issues with smell.  The air dry function works great (and probably helps with reducing any smell) - I was concerned about how wet dishes would be, but we let them sit for another hour or so after the door opens at the end of the cycle before unloading, and everything is dry except the sometimes plastics need additional dry time.

Amazing Dishwasher,"This dishwasher does everything it advertises - the dishes comes out fully cleaned with no streaks, it is easy to load, the Auto Air feature works flawlessly, and the 3rd rack is the most useful feature for those who cook a lot and have oversized utensils.  We upgraded to a Bosch dishwasher in our previous home and missed how well it performed when we moved to our new home at the beginning of this year.  Fortunately the dishwasher in our new home was old enough where it needed to be replaced and we immediately searched Bosch dishwashers for a replacement. We enjoy the product and always recommend it to friends and neighbors when they are looking for a new dishwasher.  Thanks. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]",100,"October 27, 2020"
exceeded my expectations,"I wanted the 800 series but it did not come in white so I settled for the 500 series thinking it would not dry as well, however it is great! [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]",100,"October 26, 2020"

Great dishwasher!,"I replaced a Miele with this unit, so it was a slight step down, however, still an excellent choice.  Had a comparable Samsung at first, but it was terrible.  This unit is quiet, and actually cleans the dishes.  My only complaint or issue with it is that bowls are difficult to load in a way that they don't move around.  Also, sometimes it seems to change programs.  In other words, I can select 'normal' and 'air dry', yet at the end of the cycle it won't open on it's own.  When I manually open the door, it is on 'auto' and nothing else.  We've had the unit about 6 weeks and this has happened 3 or 4 times, running almost daily.  Strange, but not a huge issue.  Overall, I'm very pleased with the quality.  It also holds many more dishes than older models. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]",80,"October 25, 2020"
Best dishwashers,This is our 3rd home and and first thing we change is putting in a Bosch dishwasher. They are sooo quiet and dishes come out perfect. We like this model because at the end of the cycle the door pops open to help with drying ( plastics come out dry). The 3 racks are nice and can fit a lot of dishes. Will not buy any other dishwasher! [This review was collected as part of a promotion.],100,"October 25, 2020"

No one asked us about where the dishwasher was in relation to the sink.  Then my floor needed to be pulled up in order to get the old one out.  The third time someone came to install it went well.,100,"October 25, 2020"
So quiet!,Dishes come out sparkling clean! I still am unsure of how to get the strings right and I've had it over a month. I can't get the door to automatically open after the load is done like it did earlier in the month. The directions are confusing as are the setting buttons.

Love my Bosch,I have been using my 500 series Bosch and using all the different settings!  I have found this dishwasher is the best dishwasher I have ever own!  It washes items  I could have never gotten clean in my other washes.  Sometimes some of my plastics bowls and some cups with curves on top are not dry but that was with others dishwashers too.  I just take a towel and dab it dry!  I like the the third tray for my silverware and utensils easy to to load and especially unloading.  Leaves room on the bottom rack for large items.  The one con I have is that I don't like the way the lights stay on until I turn them off.  It could be several hours before I get to it!  Overall I give it a 5 star rating.

Lucky for me, this appliance was in stock.  I couldn't be happier.  The machine is really quiet, does an amazing job and has perfect options.  Finally, I love the top third shelf.

So quiet & powerful cleaning,Really great dishwasher. Our original one to the house broke down & we needed a new one. Inlaws had a Bosch and we heard great things. We decided to spend an extra hundred and get the next model up. This is so quiet it has a red light shining on the floor to let you know its running.

Misleading info,"The description of this dish washer shows a top ""silverware"" rack.  There isn't one.  
It cleans and dries the dishes quite well.  Doesn't hold as many dishes as our old washer.  Would be a 4 if it would have had the top tray as shown in the pictures.",60,"October 21, 2020"
"Best shelf configuration, best cleaning, quietist!","Best Dishwasher I've ever bought! I was REALLY concerned about the hefty price tag, but I needed a didhwasher now (chronic pain prevents me from doing all our dishes by hand), and there was only top of the line or bottom of the heap available because of Covid. 
   We've never had a Bosch but had always heard they were excellent! This has certainly justified it's price point! The 1st feature we were attracted to, was the Leak guard- after 2 dishwashers breaking and flooding, damaging our Laminate floors (the latest one's water pump broke & shot water onto the floor + right in the basement the last time we turned it on & went outside!) we love Leakguard! Plus we love the features I mentioned in the title. We have a spring fed well that has a lot of water but not pressure, and this Bosch still manages to get dishes cleaner than any other brand we've ever had! Plus I can put SO many dishes and utensils in it! For the 2 of us, I don't even need the Cutlery Basket! ... can't even hear it when it's running, but love the red light on the floor telling us it is! Love, love the feature where the door pops open at the end to save some electricity in the drying & dishes come out dryer overall! 
  Only one slight little problem and it might have been our installers mistake because it is not in the whole lined up exactly with the counter -one side sticks out more- The middle shelf keeps rolling out and won't hardly ever stay in while loading the other shelves.

Great dishwasher,"As expected this dishwasher is very quiet. I love that the door pops open when it's done to air dry the dishes. I always just use the auto setting, it takes 3 hours which seems a bit long but plan accordingly. I love the top rack for silverware and utensils. It takes me awhile to get a full load of dishes and they can start smelling before I run a cycle, so I always keep the door open at the same angle that it pops open when it's done. So its open 4 inches which is kind of annoying to walk around, but a necessary thing for my usage. I also like that this doesn't have a handle sticking out that gets caught on my pants pockets when I walk by it. All the controls are on top and hidden under my counter when closed. It was easy self-installation. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]",100,"October 20, 2020"

Quiet little clean machine,"I love my Bosch dishwasher, except for one thing.  Not one time have all of my dishes been dry...and I do use the pop open feature to air dry after the cycle.  Anything on the top rack, like coffee cups or ramekins, have water on the top of them.  Other than this, my dishes get really clean and the glasses have no residue.

Happy with our new dishwasher,"First time with a Bosch product.  Very happy so far (had it about 1 month).  I do like the third rack for silverware very much.  Haven't quite figured out what to do with the space where the removable basket is and haven't quite figured out what to use that basket for since I use the top rack for knives, spoons, forks, etc.  But extremely quiet, cleans and dries well, like the red light that tells me it is on.",100,"October 19, 2020"

Look No Further,"This dishwasher isn’t so quiet, living in a city rowhome that is super important to us.  It does an excellent job cleaning, even heavily spiked cookware and there are so many customizable options, I would look nonforther when I’m the market for a new DW. This is my second Bosch since we recently bought a new home, and will never buy another brand. We loved our 2018 Series 300, which is a little less money and would be a comparable and great option as well. I noticed with this 500 series, the front is easier to clean and leaves less steak marks than the 300. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]",100,"October 18, 2020"

My Bosch,It was so quiet that I thought it was not working. My copper bottom pans look brand new when they come out of the dishwaster. My only suggestions would be to add a little more depth to the top cutlery basket so that you could place small low cups or large spoon ladels on top. It drys just great with very little water pooling on a few items. I would buy it again! [This review was collected as part of a promotion.],100,"October 16, 2020"
Bosch Dishwasher Has Changed Our Lives!,"Our old dishwasher was so loud we had to turn the TV way up to hear over it. We were even thinking of adding doors to our dining room to block the sound! Our new Bosch 500 Series dishwasher is so quiet, you can only hear it or know it's running when the water discharges.  The door opens automatically when the wash cycle is complete, to let steam out, so I can let it run before bed and know that the dishes will be perfectly dry in the morning, and I don't have to wait for cycle to be finished to open the door!

Dishwasher Review,"It cleans extremely well.  After the first wash, a tea stain I thought was there forever, was gone.  Unfortunately,  it does not dry as well.  Using half load and air dry helps a lot, but thete is always some water in the machine.  This sometimes creates a slightly unpleasant odor unless the machine is left open for much of the day.

Excellent Design,"After years of dirty dishes from a dishwasher we decided to upgrade. I of course did not want just any dishwasher. I was on the hunt for one that was both reliable and cleaned dishes well. After months of research from reading reviews and testimonies I wanted to check out the few hopefuls in person. The Bosch design was a clear winner. One or our favorite aspects is the top silverware drawer. No more basket taking up room or hanging on the door. We also love that the top rack can be raised and lowered if needed. Which is has been several times. As for cleaning, this machine has surpassed our expectations. Previously we has to run a load twice and still deal with water spots. Which the Bosch we run it once and everything is sparkling clean. The one feature I was hard pressed to get was Auto Dry. After the load is complete the door pops open and lets everything air dry. It's an amazing feature even though it is so simple. One last thing we did notice was the noise level of this machine. We actually can't hear it running, at all. The previous machine sounded like a baby rhino playing with a pressure washer. dishes crashing around water spray noise for three hours. It was aweful. Two loads and 6 hours later we would be scrubbing water spots. Now we are blissfully running a silent machine any time we want knowing in only 2 hours the load will be complete and everything will be clean. Thank you Bosch, this machine is a marvel of engineering. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]",100,"October 9, 2020"
Great Washer,We replaced a 10 year old dishwasher. So glad we did. The Bosch is so quite compared to our last unit. We also love the fact that it opens automatically when the cleaning finishes ( this is an option ). We also enjoy having the top slid out shelf. The only reason we did not give it a 5 was due to it's sensitivity when something may be loaded incorrectly. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.],80,"October 9, 2020"

Just what a small house needed,"My dishwasher was 10 years old and it wasn't working the way it used to, so I went to work researching dishwashers.  I knew I wanted a quieter dishwasher because my small house has open space between the kitchen and living room and my old dishwasher was, well, super loud.  After months of research and saving up and finding a weekend where we could install it ourselves, we bought the Bosch 500 Series.  It's everything I wanted and then some.  I love the fact that I can run the 500 and watch television or read a book at the same time.  I love that I can take conference calls sitting 10 feet away from it and nobody knows it's on.  I could write for an hour about how clean my dishes are! Definitely worth the investment. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]",100,"October 8, 2020"

Peace and quiet,"It is heavenly, being able to watch and listen to the TV or have a conversation at the table while the dishwasher is running and there is no need to turn up the volume or to raise ones voice to be heard.  That was what we had to do with our 26 year old dishwasher while it attempted to clean our dishes; and it do do an adequate job.  But our new Bosch, it is a heavenly experience avery time we use.  Total peace and quiet!  Thank goodness for the little red light that shines on the floor while running, otherwise one would think its not working, it is that quiet.  And talk about it doing its job.  The dishes and glassware come out sparkling clean, and the utinsils, pots, pans baking dishes, well, it is abosolutely amazing the job it does.  And the greatest thing about it is there is no pre-rinsing  of dishes etc. before loading them into the dishwasher.  Just follow the instructions and one cannot go wrong, and that includes the installation instructions.  Good job Bosch, but then I may be a bit partial to Bosch because most of my woodworking tools are Bosch. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]",100,"October 8, 2020"

Bosch Diswasher,"After going through three diswashers in five years, we decided to up our game to purchase a higher-level product that had great reviews. After hearing from several friends who swear by Bosch, we found the perfect diswasher for us. One of my favorite features include the adjustable racks- suitable for our large dinner plates, wine glasses, and the pot from our Instant Pot.  I also LOVE the top shelf that is hidden. It is perfect for lids, utensils and other oddly shaped pieces. 
 I also LOVE how the door releases and opens as the final step of the cleaning process. I start the machine when I go to bed and dishes are dry when I come to empty it in the morning. Finally, the low level of noise from the washer when in use is AMAZING! We will never buy another dishwasher from any other company. The BOSCH is the only way to go! I am thrilled with the product.

The only difference we saw between it and the step up and step down models was the drying options. We chose the 500 series because of the AutoAir feature. The door pops open and lets out the heat/steam from the dry cycle so the dishes can actually dry. All of these new dishwashers are so air tight that if you don't open the door the steam has nowhere to go and the dishes are covered in condensation. I didn't believe that a dishwasher could be so quiet that you don't know it is running, but I am now a believer. It is a good thing it projects a red beam of the floor to confirm it is on because sometimes that is the only way I know it is running. No more having to wait until we go to bed to run a cycle. One of the other selling points the Bosch machines had was the 3rd rack on top for silverware/utensils. No more wasting room on the bottom with the removable basket to hold silverware. Everything fits nice and neat on the top rack and also has room for shallow storage containers, lids and water bottle lids. We have had our Bosch for almost a month and run it nearly every day. I am kicking myself for not buying it sooner. I didn't realize my old dishwasher was not getting my dishes as clean as this machine. I always contributed my dishes not shining to our hard South Texas water, even with rinse aid and a hard water supplement. This machine has proved it is not the water. We still use rinse aid, but no longer need the hard water supplement and the dishes still look cleaner than our last dishwasher could accomplish.",100,"October 7, 2020"

Great product,"The design is exactly what we were looking for, sleek on the outside without a projecting handle and very functional on the inside.  The 3 racks can hold a lot of dishes and the upper racks have some features to where you can slightly modify the vertical position in order to accomodate larger items.  The stainless steel tub and the racks all seem durable and not flimsy or cheap. 
It is very quiet as needed for an open floor plan.  It doesn't interupt dining conversation or T.V. watching.
I don't like how the door stays propped open at about 6"" to 8"" I would rather have it at just a couple of inches.  That is the only reason I gave it 4 stars instead of 5. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]",80,"October 5, 2020"

"Really good performance, really bad doc","There's an adage that nothing ruins a good price like bad service. In this case, nothing ruins a good product like bad manuals... and color choices.

The machine itself is very well-designed, extremely efficient, and fabulous at cleaning dishes. It's just not intuitively obvious to use.

The manuals (documentation) is something only an engineer could love. Components are highlighted with numbers, not with callouts that describe their function, and the legend for those numbers is on a different page. And when you get around to the operating instructions, you need to refer back to those numbers (on one page) and legend (on another). So there's a lot of (avoidable) flipping back and forth.

Then try changing a setting on the control panel. Go ahead. Push the On/Off button and then try to change to something other than Auto. I'll wait. Until you press and hold the Start button for a moment (a procedure which, found buried in the manual, resets the panel), you can't make another choice. Oh, yeah, sure, that's obvious. It would be like first having to disconnect your car battery any time you wanted to change gears.

Red may mean go in Germany, but not in the States. So when the machine is on, and its red light shines on the floor, the first implication is that it's a warning light, not an ""on"" light. Then, when the light goes off and one would assume that the cycle is complete, it's not. The washing has stopped, but the drying has not. Must be a Teutonic thing that escapes the comprehension of a simple American.

To other people, these might be charming German quirks. To me, they're as bad as all those American firms that (years ago) didn't see the point in translating their brochures from English into the languages of the countries they sold to. There are cultural differences that are just as important, and they need to be adopted... even when it's something  as simple as changing a light bulb cover from red to green.

worst dishwasher ever,"Not sure what the hype is about bosch dishwashers but after living with this thing for 4 months, I’ve come to loath it. Sure its a little quieter than our old GE dishwasher but thats the only plus. The soap dispensor is a joke and due to its placement and design, it requires you to use 1 type of soap or wind up with soap caked and oozing from the dispensor at the end of the cycle. The layout of the dish racks makes little sense and we regularly find ourselves fighting with it to just get the days dirty dishes washed. The autoair feature has to be one of the worst designs put into production. From day one, our dishes were never dry. Regardless if we used the higher temp sanitize option or not. So now when a cycle is done, were now drying every dish off as we empty it. As an added bonus, if something does happen to dry on Its own, its so spotted and covered in a fine film that we end up washing it again by hand. This issue is persistent with or without rinse aid.  If i could give this thing a negative score i absolutely would. I now dream of the day that i can finally rip this piece of junk out and leave it on the side of a very remote and abandoned road!",20,"September 27, 2020"

"Bad decomposition Toxic sewage smell , no air flow","These dishwasher have a serious flaw in there design, that flaw seems to be no air flow when you close the door. You put dirty dishes in close the door and within just a few hours it smells like a sewage. I never had this problem with my old dishwasher.  If you were to leave dirty dishes in for let’s say a week you would need a hazmat suite on before you open the door. The dishwasher seems to act like some kind of greenhouse decomposition chamber. The only way to prevent this is to leave the door hanging open; great look that does not get in the way all (sarcasm off). I do not recommend any buy any of these Bosch models, they are not sanitary.",40,"September 26, 2020"
Anticipation and first impressions,"After several years of listening to the loud dishwasher, that still worked, I had the opportunity to replace it. Understanding that, during this COVID crisis, appliances were hard to come by leaving a lot of people waiting months for their replacements. I had the choice of this 500 Series model or a competitor equivelant. I chose the Bosch for its reputation and because, since I am a plumbing contractor and have installed hundreds over the last 24 years, I recognized its build quality right away. Now after a month my impression is that it is freakishly quiet. I like the organization options of the racks and its various run modes. 

After the first few times using it, I noticed  the door was open. I thought my teenage daughter grabbed a glass or something and forgot to close it, or better yet... empty it like she was supposed to. After the third time I walked into her room and said that if she did it again, she couldn't go out over the weekend. She swore up and down that it wasn't her... so I waited close by during a forth use and when it seemed almost complete I noticed it opened itself to let the remaining moisture breath - just like it stated in the instruction manual I should have read.

I previously had a Bosch diswasher and loved it's performance and over the past 18 years it  never needed any repair.  The only reason I got a new  Bosch dishwasher was to change to the stainless steel color.  I love the Bosh diswasher brand so much I even put one in my rental  home fifteen years ago and I have never had to do any repair on it.  My new Bosch is so  quiet I don't even realize it is on.  I love the feature of the red light on the bottom letting me know the  dishwasher is on and when the light disappears, I know the cycle is over.  A new feature to me is also the  third rack which I use a lot for  sharp knives and small items. It is designed to keep small items securely in place. I also  like a new feature of a delicate cycle.  I've used this cycle  a lot and my delicate  goblets and  glass bowls have  come out  beautifully, spot free.  I do use the recommended Finish dishwasher pods and as i am accustomed to, my dishes come out super clean and spotless.  Of all my new kitchen appliances, I love my Bosch dishwasher the best!

Bosch 500 dishwasher,Cleans great very quiet . The utensil basket takes up a lot of space it would be better to use a smaller basket or divide in two for more silverware space. Also more room on second level for small bowls. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.],100,"September 22, 2020"
Bosch Dishwasher,We have used our new Bosch Dishwasher now for a couple of months and love it.  It does a great job of cleaning and has a quite operation.

poor product poor installation,"Non-professional installation service. No lebeling, no positioning, non-professional drain hook-up.

No successful drain make stinky smell out.

Great Upgrade!,"We purchased out Bosch dishwasher about a month ago.  It was a great upgrade for us!  It took some time to adjust to the different cycles, options and the silence!

Almost as good as expected,"This dishwasher is very, very quite. It's a good thing there is a 'light' on the door indicating it's running, otherwise I wouldn't know. The only feature that I would like to have is a heater coil of some type to dry the dishes in a quicker manner instead of having the door automatically pop open when finished and air dry naturally. Also, the 'not necessary to rinse' isn't quite there. You still need to rinse some of your dishes before putting them in the dishwasher.

Best cleaning but bit noisy,Really is the best cleaning dishwasher we have ever had. But it is noisier than the KitchenAid we replaced. That seems odd considering how Bouch touts how quiet their machines are and has the red light that shines on the floor to let you know it is running. Red light is a marketing gimmick unless we just have a problem and ours is extra loud. We always know when it is running. Our old KitchenAid was so quiet that we often didn't know when it was running. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.],80,"September 20, 2020"
Quiet & Efficient,"Replaced my noisy, inefficient Kitchenaid with the Bosch 500 series dishwasher. It's very quiet; can barely tell it's running, the only indicator is the red light that shines on the floor while its operating. Cleans very well too. I like the top rack; we play train dominoes often and the dominoes get really dirty. I put them in the silverware box or on the top rack and they come out sparkling clean! I also have the Bosch gas cooktop with the 18000 btu middle burner, it's awesome!  Highly recommend these appliances. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]",100,"September 20, 2020"

Stop shopping and buy this one,"This is the dishwasher you want if you want quiet operation and clean dishes. The top shelf for silverware is an unexpected delight. If you load it properly, you can easily scoop up all the table knives, forks and spoons with one hand and put them back in the drawer. Also, for bigger serving pieces there is an adjustment for extra space. 
The On/Off switch seems unncessary to me, so I followed the manual directions and set it to automatically power off after washing. It's probably a German thing. If you want to drive a German mad, leave a door ajar in his house. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]",100,"September 19, 2020"

Game Changer,"OK, so since our total remodel 12 years ago, this has been our third dishwasher. The first was serviceable; the second pretty useless. We've been handwashing for the last two years.
Our neighbor got a Bosch around Thanksgiving of last year and had been raving about it. His wife called it a game-changer; he called it a life-changer. My wife and I were a little more skeptical. Finally, as the pandemic hit, and we were doing MANY more dishes than before, we decided to buy one.
Game-changer indeed. Everything gets clean. Sparkling. And the damned thing is quiet.
So, yeah, I'm sold. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]",100,"September 18, 2020"

Bosch 500,"The Bosch replace a 10 year old Whirlpool DW.  It is very quiet, we don't even realize it is on.

I am a weirdo and like to put all the silverware together in like groups, however, this dishwasher doesn't get them clean like that, so you have to mix them up to they won't ""spoon"".

While the 800 series may have been quieter, I'm not sure it would have made any difference in the performance factor of cleaning our dishes. Every thing we have washed has come out sparkling clean.  Haven't really tried optional settings yet, just normal settings and have been pleased with results. Plastic does not dry very well but my improve as we learn to load it properly.  Really like the adjustable racks and third level rack.  So far, it does what we expected from. Bosch dishwasher and probably glad we didn't pay the extra cost for the 800 Series model.

Love this dishwasher,"We moved into a house that came with a 16 year old Bosch, so when it stopped working one day, we knew we wanted to replace it with another Bosch. This is not the dishwasher we went into the store to purchase, but it was the one they could get to us in a timely fashion and it was actually a step up from the one we were looking at it. We have no regrets and love this thing. The silverware tray on the top is my favorite because I can meticulously load the silverware for easier unloading. My husband isn't a huge fan of it, but he prefers to just drop all the silverware in and be done. Aside from that, the middle rack has SO MUCH space we almost don't even need the bottom row! We can put in three times the dishes we used to be able to (which is great because our kids use 16 bowls a day). [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]",100,"September 10, 2020"
First Bosch,"Replaced Kenmore after it wore out.  So far Happy with the Bosch.  Cleans well and quiet.

However, overall space and layout not quite as good as before for fitting in a variety sized bowls, pans, etc.  Proof of my overall satisfaction will be in the longetivity, need to give it another 8 years or so.

New Bosch SHXM65Z55M - First Impressions,"Just finished installing this new dishwasher and ran it through a test cycle.  This is the 3rd dishwasher that has been installed in this particular spot in our kitchen,  The prior two, a GE and then later a Kitchenaid, had the water hookup and the electric hookup within the same space as the dishwasher which actually worked out pretty well.  Since this dishwasher requires that you connect the electric and water supply in the adjacent cabinet (typically the cabinet with the sink) I had to modify the water supply and the electric supply to move them into the adjacent cabinet.  Not a real fan of this as you can't really tell how everything is lining up in the back of the cabinet as you push the dishwasher in and pull the slack from the drain line, the water supply line and electric cord through the opening into the sink cabinet.  You can't see under this dishwasher at all when it is in position.  The older dishwashers provided a view of everything under the dishwasher allowing replacement of some components if there were a problem without having to uninstall the dishwasher.  The adjustable front feet are not the easiest to work with when leveling the dishwasher.  The past dishwashers I have had experience with had a spot where you could put a little 1/4"" drive socket on the top of the leveling foot so that you could easily wrench the feet to where you wanted them.  The feet on the Bosch have slots in the bottom of the feet that you have to manipulate with a screw driver about 1/6 of a turn at a time.  It takes quite a while to get it set to the right height and level.  There is a center screw for adjusting the rear foot which is actually very easy to use.  There are only 3 feet on this dishwasher so it sets up like a tri-pod which makes it easier to get it very level.  

I got everything hooked up and turned it on for a short cycle just to make sure that everything worked fine and I had no leaks.  They advertise this as a quiet dishwasher and provide an LED that illuminates on the floor so that you can tell it is running.  If you need to see the LED to know that this dishwasher is running, you are deaf.  This dishwasher is not that quiet, and it is definitely not as quiet as the Kitchenaid we just replaced.  I wouldn't call it objectionable, but it is definitely going to take getting used to as it is a lot noisier than what we are used to.  They could have saved some money on that gimic LED to tell you that it is running.  

Also found a self tapping flange bolt in the bottom of the shipping materials when I opened it up.  The bolt didn't appear as though it had ever been threaded in, and I couldn't find a spot for it to go, but that didn't make me feel good to find a loose bolt.  

We hated to give up our Kitchenaid but an electric surge got into it burned out a bunch of stuff in it.",80,"September 9, 2020"

Limited rack space,"Bought this dishwasher on the reccomendation of several people, including a repairman. It is the quietest of any dishwasher we have owned and does an excellent cleaning job. However, the racks for holding glasses (especially long stem wine glasses) are inadequate. Also the storage for bowls and cups is limited or configured too tightly to accomodate many. Top utensil rack is wonderful and allows good cleaning of utensils unlike basket arrangements.

If the connection hookup gets pushed too hard it becomes loose and washer does not operate.  Have had the installer come out to fix.  He says the chord is too short.  So I said get a longer one.

Love it!,This 500 series is very quiet and very efficient. I love the auto dry option the dish are clean and dry. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.],100,"September 5, 2020"
Mixed Bag,"Let me start out with the positives:  (1) truly whisper quiet (the thing with the laser dot on the floor -- you would not always be sure whether the machine was running without it); (2) cleans really well; (3) dries decently but not super well; (4) adjustable rack is pretty useful; and (5) the third rack for utencils is very neat, works pretty good, and makes sorting and emptying a breeze.  Now the negatives (which are a bit harder to quantify):  (6) the front door on this dishwasher looks great but feels super cheap and does not convey quality (we previously owned a less expensive Bosch bought a decade ago and it felt more sturdy); (7) the racks feel cheap and fragile (they are seem very lightweight (which is good) but feel as if you could break them by mistake (not so good) -- it makes adjusting the middle rack a bit scary); (8) the basket on the bottom rack has almost no capacity and the things we manage to put in them tend to not get clean; and (9) the third rack does not seemed to allow for curved utencils -- it is as if Bosch expects all of our flatware to actually be flat.

I trust the Bosch brand based on our great experience with the prior dishwasher.  I hope this dishwasher proves to be the rule rather than the exception.  But the overall feel of this machine is definitely cheaper than the machine we bought before for less.  Go figure. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]",80,"September 5, 2020"

Well....,"I had a Bosch many years ago in another home.  I loved it.  I always wanted a new one in my new home and finally bought it.  I am not very happy with the job it does; doesn't seem to get my dishes clean, and I have to run it on ""heavy"" every time I use it.  It certainly looks great, and you do not hear it running, which is a big plus.

Still not pleased,"I purchased this dishwasher after reading the Consumer Report reviews and having previously purchased an Ascenta (1 month earlier and returned it).  I had high hopes as Bosch specifically said no pre-rinsing needed).  But, I have been disappointed in the amount and size of dishes/pots/pans that I can get in the dishwasher and the cleaning ability.  I have never pre-rinsed with my two previous dishwashers (2 before Bosch) except for the usual, egg, beans, ...  I find that I have to pre-rinse a lot now to make sure things come out clean.  It had another little quirk right at the one month of purchase mark where it was taking 3.?? hours to clean and Air dry.  Now it says 2.58...  I do very much like the Air Dry feature.  The top rack would be nice, but it makes the middle rack too short for glasses to stand up, very frustrating as the bottom rack is loaded with dishes, pot and pans...

Bosch dishwasher — a winner!,I’m enjoying everything about my new dishwasher.  It cleans everything I throw at it.  I always choose the option of “Auto Dry” that pops the door open at the end of the cycle to vent steam.  This does a fine job of drying the dishes.  The only thing I wish for is that it’s hard to easily tell when I’ve added enough rinse aid.  I often overflow a bit if I add too much.

I had a lot of issues as the manual I was able to find on line are not very clear. It's not a straight forward thing as I couldn't turn off the lights after using the Air Dry feature as well as any other feature. You physically have to hit the off button. Which is crazy bc I run my dishwasher at night after we go to bed. The manual did explain how to change that factory setting but like I said wasn't easy. So it received 4 stars as an overall rating. If it wasn't for the on line book I would be at a total loss. It cleans the dishes well and has an amazing third rack for small things and silverware. No handle sticks out and although I mentioned quiet it is sooo quiet you won't realize it's on.,80,"August 28, 2020"
Our new Bosch diswasher,"Very impressed with this appliance, how the dishes are left clean,  and the quietness with which it operates. Only issue was an odor noticed anytime the dishwasher was opened when it had a load of dirty dishes. But a calm to your service number explained that should not fully close the door between loaded allowing some air to circulate. That alleviated our issue. So besides an excellent appliance your company also has a respectful and knowledgable service department. We highly recommend this brand of appliances. This is the first Bosch productive own and will definitely consider your entire product line going forward. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]",100,"August 28, 2020"

500 Series Dishwasher - very satisfied,"I have always wanted a Bosch Dishwasher.  Mainly for the reputation of it operating quietly.  It is so quiet on the automatic setting that I cannot hear it running.  Some of the other settings - like speed 60 - are a bit louder, but still SO MUCH quieter than my previous dishwasher.  If your dishwasher is in the heart of the home like mine, you need the quiet perfromance offered by this Bosch dishwasher.  The dishwasher also performs excellently.  My dishes and glassware are always clean and spot free.  I like the programable automatic door opening air dry feature.  The adjustable middle rack makes it easy to fit all sizes of items.  The filter is very easy to clean.  The buttons are on the top panel which lends to a clean, neat aesthetic in the kitchen. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]",100,"August 27, 2020"

Quietest Dishwasher Ever!,"Purchased a BOSCH 500 Series dishwasher with air dry function about 1 month ago. The dishwasher is very quiet, cleans my dishes well, and looks sleek in my kitchen. I have 2 minor complaints...the first is that streaks and fingerprints show on the front. The fingerprintless model was not available in the line I wanted. The other complaint is the need to close the door within 4 seconds of pushing start. This function had not been explained to me upon installation. I had to contact the BOSCH helpline to learn how to reset the control panel. Assume that this could be a common problem encountered by new owners. Otherwise, the dishwasher is wonderful and I would purchase it again. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]",80,"August 26, 2020"
Dishwasher is very quiet but normal cycle with air dry...,"Dishwasher is very quiet but normal cycle with air dry is 3 hrs! there is a 60 min cycle so that's what I use.  My old washer was a 10 yr old GE monogram. I'm not a big fan of GE equipment but it does feel heaver and more solid than the Bosch.  I've only had the Bosch for 2 weeks. so I'll update this review later. 

Delivery was a disaster - did not come with extra parts I ordered and delivery people would not take old washer unless it was disconnected, wished they told me that before hand. Also trying to call Home Depot helpline is useless. Waste hours being on hold and nobody knows or can do anything.  

Conclusion: Washer seems good (self-install was huge pain!) but too early to tell, delivery service and HD help terrible.  Probably a good idea to buy from another vendor.",80,"August 26, 2020"

Horrible Interior Design,"We purchased this dishwasher because the sales rep said it was the top of the line for dishwashers and the most quiet. It cleans nicely, however the interior design is horribly constructed and makes NO sense. On the bottom row the plate slats are far too close together, not to mention you have them going in opposite directions as the other sections, they end up  impeding on each other.  You can't put a casserole dish in and if you do just be prepared that 1/2 your rack on the bottom will be used. The cutlery holder on the bottom also interferes with the direction of grids, yes you can push them down, but then it's basically empty space. On the second row, traditionally you have 1 row for bowls in the middle and 2 rows on each side for cups. Bosch has 2 rows for bowls, but when you set your cups on the outer side and then bowls, they grind next to each other- so again not useful or smart. 
Clearly the person who designed this never actually had to do dishes before. Regret this purchase, it's not an ideal and you spend more time washing dishes because of how much less you can actually fit.",20,"August 24, 2020"

I load the dishwasher at night and set the air dry setting and by morning the dishes are clean and dry.  I also love the third rack and how the other two racks hold dishes. I can get a lot of dishes in the washer. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]",100,"August 23, 2020"

Fantastic dishwasher,"With 7 in our household dishes are a constant. Dishwasher runs about 3x a day. Someone recommended this one and I got it. BEST decision ever. So quiet, cleans wonderfully and I love the 3rd rack. Only drawback is that it doesn't dry as well as I'd like, but that wouldn't keep me from buying it again.

"Overall, it’s what I expected.","It's sleek, easy to install and has lots of nice features.  As most will mention, it isn't the best at getting the dishes dry.  Run it overnight and in the morning majority will be dry.  I recommend starting with emptying the bottom rack first, because some water can sit on top of cups or bowls depending on your dishes and their placement. Top rack is awesome, but I wouldn't put any utensils up there that are caked with food particles.  Once you learn how to load it, it fits quite a bit.  And the adjustable rack allows for more creativity while loading.   The red floor light showing you its running is cool.  I feel happy with my upgrade.

Great Dishwasher!,"Very impressed with this dishwasher! It seems no matter how full I stuff it with dishes everything comes clean (except the occasional item with too much baked on food because I don't run it on heavy). It's audible for the first 20 minutes or so, with a few squeaking noises and water whooshing noises, but after that it's almost completely silent. I also love the auto air feature for saving energy.

44 dBA is library quiet!,"We LOVE our new Bosch dishwasher. While we didn't opt for the top of the line model, this one is amazingly quiet and incredibly effective. Dishes are spotless after every wash. Some may scoff at the price of this unit, but I want to be one to tell those people that it is worth every extra penny. Having owned several other brand dishwashers in the past 25 years, I can truly say that hands-down, this is the best unit I've ever owned.

Very Solid Choice,"I'm very happy with this dishwasher. It cleans most dishes the first time without having to scrub them, it's quiet, and I love the auto air feature which pops the door open at the end of the cycle allowing the dishes to air dry and cool off. Looks nice, very quite, I'm confident it will be the right choice for years to come.

I don't have any problems but do have two concerns that might be a problem for others. First, the drawers feel a little flimsy at times. Not sure if it will ever actually be an issue but if I was in the habit of loading a lot of heavy dishes all the time I bet they'll wear out quickly. Second issue is due to the 3rd rack and how organized the tines are it seems to have slightly less capacity than our old washer. That's not a problem for us and it's so easy to use with almost no prewashing required we could run it several times a day if needed. But if you have a large family it could be a problem.

Bosch Dishwasher,"The Bosch series runs quieter than our previous dishwasher. However, the Bosch does not have a heater and uses steam to dry which is not a feature i am liking.

A well-done dishwasher,"I researched dishwashers extensively online before deciding on Bosch.  Donald Trump there were so many models to choose from that it was difficult to zero in on the one that was right for me.  I decided on the series 500 as it seemed to have all the features that I could ask for without having to pay more for extras that would not need.
The most impressive feature of this washer is how much cleaner the glasses and dishes come out.  My wife noticed it right away and she is the expert.  My favorite feature is that it is so quiet it can run at any time I never disturb my peace and quiet.  Our last washer would need to be put on a late night timer setting so as not to disturb. From the three rack design, multiple cycle selections, in - use floor lamp and smooth rack adjustability, this unit meets all my expectations.",100,"August 21, 2020"

This is a thousand dollar dishwasher. It's obscene. And the salesman didn't know. And the website doesn't tell you when you order. Ridiculous.",20,"August 20, 2020"

MONTH 3: STINKS TO HIGH HEAVEN,"So disappointed to read all the online negative reviews about stinky Bosch dishwashers (try googling it yourself) after trying to find the cause of this horrific smell with only two months of use! After cleaning the filter (a disgusting job, wear gloves), there is still a rancid odor that won't go away, even after several very hot washes. There is also a standing pool of (dirty, I assume) water standing underneath the filter at all times. Who designed this? I never had to clean filters or run vinegar or baking soda through all the other dishwashers I have owned. Disappointed in this very expensive dishwasher. Would gladly trade for a Maytag or KitchenAid.",20,"August 19, 2020"

Bosch Dishwasher,"I recently purchased a new Bosch dishwasher. I give this product a 4 star because we have different sized plates and the set up on the bottom rack isn't the most efficient for us. There are two rows that you can put plates but when you do that, one side of the plates have to be much smaller. I do like that there are options in adjusting the rack so that wider items fit better and the very top, utensil rack is something that I am not used to but hope to use more. 
To all new customers, you can remove that thin top rack so that taller glasses will fit. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]",80,"August 18, 2020"

Getting to know my Bosch,"It's liking learning to pack a truck after driving a SUV for years. Not sure I like my Bosch yet. The extra third tray on top doesn't seem to clean utensils well enough. When it comes to adding cookie baking pans or my baking flat pans there seems to be difficulty getting them in a  good position for cleaning. I seem to lose a lot of space. Supposedly it is the standard size dishwasher but seems smaller to me. I will need more practice on my dish layout. Beware, every finger print shows too, so be prepared to clean every night. I do Love my red floor light notifing me it's still running, its very quiet. Do love the Auto Air feature and programming on the top Note!

Instead it’s easier to prevent unwashed, nested together pieces and a cinch to put away. All the hoses/ cords run low in the back corner of the Bosch d/w so I had to re-route wiring & purchase/hard wire the junction box. Again- it feels safer than having some capped wires a foot from the water inlet valve underneath my 10 year old Kitchen aide. The capacity seems a wee bit smaller on the lower rack but I don’t mind. If you, like me, have repaired and replaced parts and rewashed/ hand washed the glasses repeatedly from your ten year old d/w, trust me this is worth the $$.

Disappointed,"We checked ratings on all brands of dishwashers before buying and Bosch was usually near the top, so we focused on getting a Bosch. They were in short supply due to Covid, so it took us a while to find the exact model we wanted. I installed the dishwasher myself, which was pretty painless. Having used it now for about 6 weeks, I am sorely disappointed in its cleaning capability. In nearly every load we do, there are items that have to be rewashed or handwashed because they are still dirty. We also do not like the racks, which make it difficult to stack the dishes in them. We have a Bosch clothes dryer that has been a real workhorse, but I could not recommend Bosch dishwashers after our experience with this one.

Excellent choice,"New 3-tier drawer Bosch dishwasher exceeded all expectations.  The top tier is so handy for my cooking utensils and small items.

It's a dishwasher, it's not as quiet as the previous one I had. I find that most of the noise happens on starting it and also depending on how full the dishwasher is. It's louder with less things in it, you hear a lot of water sloshing around. When it is quiet I like being able to see that it's running with the red light that shines on the floor. The top rack is definitely something to get used to, glad that I looked at the booklet showing how to load it. This does what it should: gets the dishes sparkly clean. I haven't noticed any bad smells from it like previous reviewers.",80,"August 9, 2020"
Best upgrade,"We replaced our 20-year-old white appliances to upgrade to stainless steel.  Our refrigerator, stove and microwave were all great additions. However, the Bosch dishwasher was the best of all.  It is so quiet we have to check the indicator light to see if it is running.  And the loading capacity is so much greater than our old Maytag.

$1000 and it neither cleans well nor drys,"The Bosch dishwashers uses a condensation drying process.  In other words, THERE IS NO HEATING ELEMENT!  We were excited to invest in what we thought was a quality product with numerous reviews and make washing dishes by hand a thing of the past.  We were sadly, disappointed.

The good: Looks to be a nice unit.  It is quiet.

The bad: Cleaning can be hit or miss.  We pre-rinse heavy dirt from our dishes to reduce re-deposit, but still, often dishes are taken out and need to be re cleaned by hand.  Further, dishes are always wet.  We contacted Bosch and expressed out disappointment and they found that we follow all best practices.  Jet-Dry and tablet dishwasher soap is used that comes with the product in sample form.  They suggested a technician come out to check out the unit.  The tech found one of the blade arms was narrow and widened it.  Cleaning was a bit better but still hit or miss.  Drying was still abysmal and dishes continued to have a mildew oder.  I've owned dishwashers at half the cost of this unit that worked far better in terms of cleaning and actually left dishes dry.  This is all remarkably shocking as we read many reviews declaring this dishwasher one of the best at cleaning AND drying.  Perhaps we got that one problematic unit that happens from time to time, but Bosch has refused to refund our money.  We really just wanted a good dishwasher and were willing to spend the money to get a good one.  Sadly, the Bosch 500 did not deliver.",20,"August 9, 2020"

stick with what works,"This is our 2nd Bosch 500series washer that we installed over a 2 house period.  We loved it so much the first house, when we moved, it was the first appliance we replaced.  Quiet. Sleek.  Quality.  The added feature I like a lot is that it opens the door and allows air to help dry.

QUIET.,"After we finally gave up on our last dishwasher because it stopped cleaning, we decided to look at Bosch models. We did our research and selected the 500 series. 
Because of the location of our dishwasher in our home the previous model made it difficult to have a conversation in our den while it was operating. We knew we made the right choice as soon as we installed the Bosch model. THIS THING IS Q-U--I-E-T. (So quiet, as a matter of fact that Bosch projects a red light on the floor in front of the dishwasher just so you know it is operating.)
In addition to being quiet Bosch does a great job cleaning as well. Dishes come out clean and spotless every time. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]",100,"August 8, 2020"

Not the best dishwasher I have ever owned.,"Not the best dishwasher I have ever owned but definitely the most expensive. Yes it quiet and yes it doesn't use much water. It does clean the dishes pretty if you use the right detergent and rinsing agent. Bad things are is that it has a sour smell if you leave the door open to dry or keep it closed. More bad is it does not dry the dishes so not matter what setting you have it on you're going to have wet dishes. Pretty sure that's why it has the sour smell. Last thing, it is hard to program. You have to pull the manual out every time you want to change a setting due to the codes that have to be changed on the display that you will never remember.",40,"August 5, 2020"
Product Review,";We could not be happier with any appliance then we are with our new Bosch dishwasher!  We have a Bosh dishwasher in ou Condo in Bellevue, WA and have had fabulous results so when it became time to replace the dishwasher at our vacation home in Oregon we insisted on a Bosch.  We can not get over. How do quiet the unit operates and we have never had our dishes so clean at this location. We are Bosch consumers for life.

I know this is not the forum to comment on such things but I cannot find another place to do so. The dishwasher itself seems to be pretty amazing -- based on the ""test"" while the installers were here, it is so quiet you can hardly tell it's running. The traditional top rack is so easy to pull out and push in that it may take some getting used to (to avoid overdoing it). 

The delivery/installation experience has been nothing short of AWFUL. Buyer beware. We were given a 4 hour installation window, and the installers showed up nearly 3 hours AFTER the expiration of the window. They first argued with me that it was impossible to remove our previous dishwasher as the kitchen cabinets must have been built after it was installed, however we know this was not the case as we were the ones who had the previous dishwasher installed after we bought the house -- and with the existing kitchen cabinets already in place. When they finally relented in their complaining, they pulled the old dishwasher out so hard that it broke part of our cabinet. They could not have seemed less interested in what they were doing. Once the new one was installed, they demonstrated for us that it was working (meaning turned on and not leaking), and were on their way. It was only when we went to actually use it the first time that we discovered that they never actually ""anchored"" it to anything -- when we open the door and pull out the bottom rack, the dishwasher fell forward out of the opening. It is literally just sitting on its legs and attached to nothing! I called 3 times to try to get this fixed (getting to the right area was a bit challenging), and the ""best"" they could finally do was to send a crew out a full week after the original installation. Very, very disappointing. Had we known it would be like this, we would have never purchased this dishwasher from Home Depot. We will never purchase another appliance from Home Depot given this absurd installation experience.",100,"August 5, 2020"

Good upgrade from older Bosch,"We replaced our 12 year-old Bosch with this model. The old one still worked, but was so covered in scale that it was on its last legs - I'll use rinse agent from here forward. 

The drawers on the new unit are much better suited to our tableware in all respects. We're getting used to the 3rd drawer - we find we get back the extra time spent loading it when we unload, and it does free up space for a larger load overall.

A red dot illuminates on the floor when it's running, otherwise we wouldn't know it's operating. One fun feature is you can program it to partially open once the cycle is completed, thereby releasing the moist hot air trapped inside, but I'll wait until summer is over to activate it. Easily the best dishwasher we've ever owned. One caveat: If you're installing it yourself, be aware that it requires some interesting modifications. For instance, the water line attaches in the right rear rather than the left front, and if you're hard-wiring, you'll need the optional terminal adapter. Current You-Tube videos don't apply. The bottom is somewhat sealed. It can be a tight fit, but it WILL fit. Absolutely order the recommended accessories, you'll need them.

I also liked the adjustable second rack as well as the adjustable third rack to work for some bigger utensils as it can drop down slightly to give more room.  Also a nice feature is the door that holds the soap slides open and closed.  This is nice compared to the flip up ones as where it is placed it cant really be blocked from opening.  I love the autoair and open when done feature.  Also it is so quiet that you wouldn't know its running without the red light projected on the groud.  I instaled it myself and it was pretty straight forward and pretty darn easy.  I had to add the extra direct power line box as my dishwasher was hard wired but it was a piece of cake.  The only thing I did not like was the instructions on install around the little tabs to connect the dishwasher to the top of counter or side of cabients.  The little pictures didnt make much sense to me but I figured it out.     Outside of that it was easy to install, cleans the dishes great, is quite, and ill be looking to bosch for other appliacnes as needed.  I used to by a Samsung and LG guy but this really changed my mind.  In fact, even the delivery guys raved about it.  Looking forward to many years of use.

Dishwasher review,The BEST dishwasher I have ever owned!   Super quiet and really cleans the dishes [This review was collected as part of a promotion.],100,"July 29, 2020"
Quiet and cleans well,"I bought this dishwasher to replace a GE Profile that came with the new house.  I bought it on the recommendation of the Home Depot appliance salesperson.   This unit is amazingly quiet.  If not for the red light shining on the floor, I wouldn't know it was the on.  The dishes come clean even with caked on sauces and food.   It took some time to get the setting right for drying.  There is no heating coil inside the unit and it dries differently than most ""American"" units.   Once you get used to that and find the right setting, you will love this machine. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]",100,"July 29, 2020"
Great Dishwasher,"Before buying We read reviews for all dishwashers and this one was rated the best.  Now that we have been using this dishwasher for a couple of months we agree that it is the best.  It holds a lot of dishes and is very quiet. My only compliant is that every time I fill the rinse agent,  it runs over the side. And the rinse agent is supposed to last for several washings, but I have to fill it each time. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]",100,"July 29, 2020"
Quiet - solid performer,This is a solid performing dishwasher. We find it works best using the recommended detergent pods and rinse agent. This is our second Bosch (second home) and we replaced a 2 year old GE that was broke more than it worked. Thank you Bosch. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.],100,"July 29, 2020"

So quiet,"Love this dishwasher, it is so quiet and does a wonderful job. In an open concept home having a quiet dishwasher is on the top of the list. The Bosch 500 is the one.  I love the cleaning cycle options. The speed cycle is one of my favorites. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]",100,"July 29, 2020"
Drying,My dishwasher does not dry?? [This review was collected as part of a promotion.],60,"July 28, 2020"
Four dishwashers in ten years,"This dishwasher cleans incredibly well. It runs virtually silently. I have a lot of hope for its longevity as this is our fourth dishwasher in ten years, but our first Bosch. Granted, we are a family of ten and often run the dishwasher twice a day. I was initially pleased with the cleaning power of each of the three non-Bosch dishwasher, but the cleaning power of this Bosch is unlike anything I have seen before. It is really impressive and I highly recommend it. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]",100,"July 28, 2020"
We are very happy with this dishwasher.  The dishes...,We are very happy with this dishwasher.  The dishes are coming out very clean and are dried completely.  It runs so quietly that you need to check for an indicator light on the floor to see if it is on before opening it.  The quick wash cycle seems to work very well if the load is not too soiled.  My only negative comment would be about the height of the 2nd shelf.  You do need to watch it and cannot put some of the taller cups up there because they hit the third row tray (for larger utensils etc).  You also can only put lower profile utensils up there on the third row tray - a large ladle would get caught on the top.,100,"July 28, 2020"
My new Bosch,"This purchase is my third Bosch dishwasher. It replaces one that was over 15 years old.  I sure miss the 28 minute cycle on the old one. My dishes are just as clean, but the shorter cycle was convenient.  I will need some time to adjust to the set up of these racks. If this model lasts near as long as the one it replaced it will be a Good investment. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]",60,"July 27, 2020"

The racks are so incompatible with a normal load of my dishes.  Seems like they tried to make them so fancy that they are no longer practical.  I finally got some rinse aid today and hope that helps with drying, but I can't believe how much moisture remains after a cycle.  And TOTALLY can't believe it takes almost 3 hours to run!!  But it seems like that is rather common in lots of dishwashers now, not just this one.  REALLY wish my KitchenAid hadn't given up on me.... I loved that dishwasher!!",20,"July 27, 2020"
A quiet dishwasher,"We purchased the 500 series Bosch dishwasher because because of its quiet operation.  It is well insulated, has stainless interior and lives up to its quiet operation reputation. I give it 4/5 because of the installation, not the operation.

There are two issues to be aware of when installing. 1. Unlike many dishwashers which are hard wired, the Bosch dishwashers require a special outlet/ junction box that is sold separately and can be a challenge to locate since it is a specialized part.
2. A critical point in the water connection is where the water line connects to the dishwasher.  There are clear warnings about cross threading the connection, but this critical component is made out of plastic and can be difficult to allign properly.

"Quiet, superb cleaning","Buying a dishwasher during the pandemic via online presents a few challenges. Not being to view in person, I had to rely on reviews.

After it was installed, we notice all of the racks were tilted.  It took a few uses to get the hang of how to load. What was amazing was how clean our dishes were. Even if we don't rinse before, nothing remains. Our old dishwasher left a mineral buildup on glasses, now they look new. The other feature is how quiet this dishwasher is when running. Don't hesitate to buy! [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]",100,"July 26, 2020"
Outstanding dishwasher!,The entire purchase experience was delightful. I installed this machine and it was really simple despite the fact that my wiring and plumbing had to change slightly. The machine is super quiet. In fact a light is projected onto the floor when it's running so you will know - clever! This is a solid high quality appliance at a price that makes it a good value. Dishes come out sparkling clean. It has a feature that opens the door in the dry cycle to completely dry your plastic ware. I think this has been my most satisfying appliance purchase.

"""What, the dishwasher is on? ""","It's sooo quiet compared to our old one, we love it. It has such a clean look to it. Really like that the auto setting opens the door for better drying. If shut up for several days it can get a little musty smelling. With just two of us, we don't run it more that 1-2x a week. It smudges more easliy than I thought, but easy enough to clean it. Can get alot more stuff in it.  Husband installed it easily. I would but one again... [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]",100,"July 26, 2020"

Runs fantastic!,"After trial and error with other brands, we bought a new Bosch to complete our kitchen remodel. It has been fantastic to say the least. We love the features of the 3rd rack and different wash cycles, but we really like the Auto-Air dry. I was a little skeptical of the Auto-Air feature as we have experienced dishes not drying completely before. We have been pleasantly surprised about how well things dry. Yes - they don't come out 100% dry, but they are very close. 
I do recommend using the Finish Quantum detergent and the Finish rinse agent.

Great Product,"After our old dishwasher broke, I was looking for something that would last from constant running of my 7 person household, and this came recommended from a co-worker.  

First impressions are that it is a great dishwasher.  Lots of useful features, but my favorites are 1) It is VERY quiet.  I wasn't even sure it was on when I first started using it.  2) The auto air feature which opens the dishwasher after it is done.

The only thing I can't comment on at this point is how robust it is.  I am running it probably 3 times every 2 days, and I hope it outlasts the 5 year warranty I have on it. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]",100,"July 20, 2020"
Bosch Series Dishwasher,"The size is just perfect for us with it being built-in, designed to fit seamlessly in our kitchen counter.

We have a young son that likes to push buttons so these are hidden away at the top of the door.

Awesome Doshwasher,"We really like our new dishwasher. It is incredibly quiet and cleans really well. We use the top third rack for silverware, instead of the silverware tray which works out really well as it frees up more space in the bottom rack. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]",100,"July 18, 2020"
Quiet and convenient,"It's quiet.  So quiet that you aren't always sure it's even on, so there's a little light shining on the floor to tell you it's running.  If you're in the same room, you can hear when it's filling, and sometimes you can hear the spray hitting pots and the like.  But compared to most other dishwashers, it may as well be a mime.

The drawers are a little unusual.  Loading tall glasses can be troublesome sometimes, especially if you also have tall things in the bottom.  But the third tray for silverware and shallow things is super handy.

The best feature, however, is something it lacks.  There is no traditional heating element at the bottom of the unit.  That means that you can put anything anywhere it'll fit.  No more having to leave glasses out because you need to wash some plastics.  Everything can go everywhere.  The trade-off is that it is much slower than other units.  An auto cycle with air-dry (a nifty feature that pops the door open a few inches to let steam out when it's done) runs just shy of 3 hours.  There are quick-wash cycles, but I haven't messed with those. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]",100,"July 18, 2020"
Our New Dishwasher,"This is the best dishwasher ever.  We did a lot of comparison shopping and reviews before we made the buy.  This was by far the best one out there, but you can never be so sure.  Well let me tell you they were correct.  My dishes all look fantastic each and every time we take them out.  The last dishwasher we had to wash them before we put them in.  Not with this one.  The old one also did not do a very good job of drying the dishes.  Very little wetness at all with the new one.  Only a bit is left on the coffee cups that have indents in the bases were the water sits.  This dishwasher is also so very quiet.  Sometimes my husband & I have to come back into the kitchen to make sure one of us started it.  This is the best dishwasher on the market.  That 3rd rack for silverware is the best idea every.

Beautifully Designed,"When we purchased our new home, the appliances in the kitchen did not match in color (white refridgerator and dishwasher; stainless stove and microwave).  The dishwasher itself, was a Bosch, but nearly 20 years old.  So, when the seal began to wear, it was our excuse to update.  During my extensive research or reviews, I found no better company than Bosch for overall quality.  My search lead me to the 500 series which was stated to have the best overall value in price, satisfaction, quality and realiability.  So far I am content with the purchase.  This machine is so quiet that if it wasn't for the convenient red light indicator, I would not know that it was running.  The sleek design and no logo allows my dishwasher to match the rest of our non-Bosch appliances.  The 3rd rack comes in handy with all our bulky utensils such as our grilling equipment.  The only gripe I have, which seems to be common is, items place on the upper racks, especially plastic, do not dry as much as we hoped for.  Other than that, I don't think we could've maid a better selection. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]",80,"July 17, 2020"

And the latch ""feels"" slightly cheap when I close the door.  Have to wait to see whether it is durable. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]",100,"July 16, 2020"

Super Quiet,"After a few hiccups with delivery and installation we are quite pleased with this product.

"Very quiet, but troublesome start","I have had this dishwasher for about 4 weeks, and it has successfully completed 3 cycles. The repairman came out after the first failure, and thought it was a faulty control board. Waited for a week to get a new board, and an appointment to come to the house and install it. He then determined that the door latched sensor was flaky, and would randomly indicate unlatched status on the door, which stops the cycle. He has ordered a new latch assembly and stronger door closing springs to see if that will fix it. The dishwasher does clean very well, and is extremely quiet when it runs. I hope to get years of uninterrupted service from this machine once it is fixed. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]",40,"July 16, 2020"
sparking clean,This dishwasher is quiet and easy much easier than previous models to keep clean.  Dishes sparkle and there is a great 1/2 load option which is perfect when you want an empty dishwasher before guests arrive!  I highly recommend this Bosch model.,100,"July 16, 2020"
So Quiet!,"I love the sleek look of this dishwasher and ease of operation.  It's so quiet that the only way I know it's running is when the water is emptied!  The extra cutlery tray allows more space for large loads, and the option for small loads is a welcome option too.  I would highly recommend this product!

I want my old Whirlpool dishwasher back!,"I feel ripped off.  This is supposed to be quiet and it is everything but quiet.  My old whirlpool dishwasher was so much quieter.  I never heard water sloshing and banging like the propeller arm is hitting something constantly, when there is nothing in the way.  It's just loud.  It reads 50 decibles and it's irritating to me that my sever year old dishwasher was so much quieter.  I really wanter to return it, but the turn around time for dishwashers right now is two weeks out or more to one installed.  There is simply no one available, but t plumber who wants to charge $400 for a basic install.  I am hoping it's just defective and they will have to replace the whole unit on their own dollar.  I am utterly disappointed in the lack of quality, ranging from poor coverage toe kick panel (23.5"" on a 24"" dishwasher). leaving gaps at side on bottom.  Total waste of money.  Saving for a new one already and won't be buying a service plan.  Be glad to have it gone in a year if this is what it is supposed to be like.",20,"July 15, 2020"
"Love it when it works, annoyed when it doesn't","So many great features - I LOVE that the door opens when it's done.  It not only aids in drying but it's a visual reminder that it's time to empty.  Also, there's different areas specifically designed for different sized bowls, plates, glasses, etc. that make it easy to load without any wasted space.  The downside:  every so often I'll walk by and see the red light on the ground flashing.  I open the door, and have no idea why the machine stopped mid-cycle.  No error code, so I have to figure it out myself??  I hit the start again, it starts working again. WHY???  I paid for a top of the line brand and could've gotten the same reliability at a quarter of the price. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]",60,"July 15, 2020"
My new Bosch,"We have had a Bosch for almost twenty years.  It finally gave out so we went shopping for a new machine.  We weren’t necessarily looking for another Bosch but another customer at the store was also looking for a new machine.  She said she did a lot of research and the Bosch was the best.  We stopped looking at the other brands and settled on  a new Bosch.  We have been using it for about a month and we love it.  There have been many improvements since we bought our other Bosch.  I like the configuration of the racks for loading.  Also, as promised, you cannot hear it running but the red light showing on the floor tells us it is running.  We love it, love it, love it!!!

"Some pros, some cons","After a couple of month's use, here's where I'm at with it.

Pros
- Quiet. This was a factor in my purchase.
- Red LED light projected onto floor. If it weren't for the red LED spot on the floor, I often would not know it's running. 
- Seems to clean OK in the lower and middle racks.
- The feature to pop-open the door after the cycle is complete is nice. It was a selling feature since I've heard that Bosch dishwashers do not dry very well. 
- Adjustable dish and glass support tines and features. So far I fold most of these out of the way, but I know they are there if needed.
- Center rack height can be adjusted to three different heights. 
- Top silverware rack has adjustable tines and outer sections, and can be removed to fit taller items in the lower rack.
- The soap dispenser fits the Kirkland-brand detergent packets.
- Easy to DIY install. The instructions are good.

Cons
- Does not dry as well as my prior 17 year old washer. I think the feature that pops the door open helps. I was under the impression that these dishwashers use heat for drying, but there is no visible heating element in the bottom. Conversely, the fact that there is no heating element in the bottom probably means that plastics can be washed on the bottom rack.
- Spacing of the dish support tines is awkward. The plate tines are so close together that only plates and thin items can be used there. Thin baking pans (1"" deep sheet pans) do not fit. The tines in the space for larger items are not aligned on the left and right sides, even when the optional tines are folded down, meaning that you cannot fit quarter-sheet pans across some sections. At best I can get three to fit, spaced farther apart than necessary, yet not far enough to fit something else between.
- This model does not have the two-piece utensil basket for the bottom. I think Bosch should include the two-piece utensil basket for all models (why keep separate inventory?), but especially for all models that have the third rack for flatware. Because of the third rack for flatware, I never need all of the full-sized utensile basket so it would be nice to reclaim that space for dishes.
- Very long cycle times compared to my prior dishwasher. 
- The stainless steel is not fingerprint resistant. This means every touch will be recorded on the surface until cleaned, and it is difficult to achieve a streak-free look when cleaning. I have found that a final clean with Windex followed by a dry paper towel gets the job done, but it takes some patience. My recommendation is to consider another color. I should have opted for black. I wonder if a company that does car wraps could cover a dishwasher with a very thin clear film? Hmmm....
- The red LED ""on"" indicator that projects onto the floor is helpful, but I wish Bosch would put the time-remaing indicator in all models that have hidden door-top controls.

Would I recommend this? Yes. But I would also suggest considering a model with better drying, less limiting tine arrangments, and the two-piece utensile basket (especially with the dedicated flatware rack).

"Nice looking, quiet","We've only had this for a few weeks but so far it has been easy to use, very quiet in use, cleans the dishes much better than the old washer and looks very clean and modern. The layout of the dish racks, being very different than our old washer, is taking getting used to but is fine. My wife prefers to use the basket in the bottom tray for silver vs. the third tray, so the third tray is getting little use. When we do put a piece of silver in it whose handle is too big for the basket, we tend to forget it, but that's our bad, not the washers.

Cleans beautifully,My new Bosch is quiet and does a wonderful job of getting the dishes sparkling clean. I love the third rack for utensils and the layout works great for loading dishes in the main section of the dishwasher. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.],100,"July 6, 2020"
Is it running?,"This is the first time I have purchased a BOSCH dishwasher.  It has a unique style, simple yet elegant look.  After my dishwasher was installed I then discovered how effective the pull out drawer for silverware or any small item.  Usually those items do not get cleaned in my many other brands I have used.  It even cleans the cake decorating tips!  But when its running you have to check the floor for the red light to make sure it's running! Yes!!! Its that quite.  I will never use another brand again so goodby to all the noisy dishwasher brands that I have used in the past.  Thank you to the makers of BOSH [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]",100,"July 6, 2020"
IT IS GREAT,"Love teh top drawer.

I looked to see the BEST online and found Bosch.,I looked at all 3 price ranges and so glad I picked this model.  It cleans so well and I LOVE the great options..  Half load and AIR DRY!  I have never owned Bosch but will now look there first for everything..  do you make cloths ;) [This review was collected as part of a promotion.],100,"July 6, 2020"
Looks great,Not sure we like the inside configuration. Our Cups and glasses must be larger than what they accounted for.......although I don't think so. Wash cycles are very long especially if you use the sanitize and air dry options. It's almost 4 hours! We love Bosch products. This one replaced a 15 year old Bosch dishwasher. I hope this one lasts as long! [This review was collected as part of a promotion.],80,"July 6, 2020"
Dishwasher,We recently replaced a Bosch dishwasher with over 12 years of operation with a new Bosch. We have never found a queiter dishwasher and I have never had a dishwasher that cleans as well as our Bosch [This review was collected as part of a promotion.],100,"July 6, 2020"
you won't regret it,"We bought this dishwasher to upgrade the one that came with our new construction home because we had a simialr model Bosch in our previous home.  Once you have it installed, and are using it on a daily basis, you will never miss those extra $$ that you spent to get a Bosch.  It is so quiet that you will have to check to see if the light is on to know whether it is running.  The third rack for silverware and small items makes so much sense, and keeps each piece separate from the others so they get clean.  We tested to 60 minute cycle with a bunch of dishes that we did not rinse and had food dried on them.  No problem.  They all came out clean.  This machine makes your life easier.

Beyond clean - it's Q-U-I-E-T,"In the market for a new dishwaster?  This is it!  Super clean dishes are standard with the added plus of a very small sound print.  Our kitchen is next to our main living area and now we can hear without the rotating splashing sound of the dishwasher doing its thing.  
I'm not just talking quiet, this is an amazing drop in sound level.  This is a WOW clean machine.  Sleek and slick wrapped in the sound of silence.  Here's to Simon, Garfunkle and Bosch - ""Echo the sound of silence"" [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]",100,"July 6, 2020"

"Great product, lacking instuctions",had to go online to find instruction (a bit of time finding correct website for instuctions)  Took quite a bit of time to understand different functions.  Installer just told us to select auto and sanitize and leave it like that.   We saw we had many choices and wanted to understand them and get all the good we could get out of it.  Took us a week of trial and error only to find that the installer nailef it.  Glad we didn't get more expensive more options model...wouldn't have used all those options.

Quietest dishwasher,"I've had a few dishwashers throughout the years, but this one is by far the best one I've ever owned!! I love the very top holder which you can place those items to wash that don't fit comfortably elsewhere, the silverware sorter, the adjustable shelf, the easy access filter, and my most favorite part is how quiet this dishwasher is!! You can't even tell it's running except for the red dot on the floor which lets you know it's on. I can put it on while we have dinner and you'd never know it was actively washing the dishes.

dishwasher,"So far, tho I have used my dishwasher only a few times since having it installed, I am pleased with its performance.  I will admit having it take almost three hours to cycle is hard to get used to but the cleaning is a-1.  However I have one proplem which I have been meaning to call on & get an explanation.  After the cycle, there appears to be an unpleasant odor coming from the dishwasher.  I have regularly checked the trap at the botton of the tray & it is clean.  I hope you can offer me a solution.",100,"July 5, 2020"

Bosch 500 Dishwasher,"Dishes are so easy to load with so much room. My favorite features are the 3rd rack (do a lot of baking and cooking so now there's more room for all the utensils used) and the auto air (it's nice that the door pops open at the end of the cycle and the dishes can air dry. Our new Bosch also cleans the dishes so well. The first time we used it we could feel and see the difference immediately in how clean the dishes were. And lastly, it's so, so quiet.

I called, and the fastest appointment available was July 8 (called on June 28). Apparently, there is an issue with the door latch, but until it is repaired, I won't know for sure.

Bosch 500 Series dishwasher,It's so quiet. If it wasn't for the red light on the floor I would not even know if was on.

500 Series Dishwasher,"Love this machine. Its so quiet that the only way you know its running is seeing the redlight on the bottom right hand side that reflects off the floor. Also like the fact that the door opensby itself so the dishes dry faster. Plus when cycle is done & door opens, you can see display lit to know that dishs are washed & not dirty. Installation was pretty easy if you have an electrical outlet in dishwasher area, if not,  you must buy direct wiring kit. Well worth the,extra effort.

Not as Good,"Our last three dishwashers have been Bosch. The previous two have been excellent in terms of performance and design. The latest is disappointing. It isn't noticeably more quiet than the last. My greatest complaint is the toddler setting--that can't be overridden--that requires one to hit the Start button again every time the door is opened after programming. Since there is no longer a front-facing display to let users know if the dishwasher is on or programmed to run later, I have to stick a note on the front each night to warn my family that the dishwasher is on.  This is a serious design fail. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]",60,"June 27, 2020"

Cleans great but sucks to load,"I love the way my Bosch 500 cleans. I love how quiet it runs.  The functions and the way it looks in my kitchen are wonderful.  But it don't get nearly as many dishes in the washer as my old appliance, particularly the second rack where our glasses go.  The way the tynes are placed and slanted and the many changes in the level of the rack (not including being able to raise it to 3 heights), leaves us with 20% less space.  I would love to give this unit 5 stars, as it checks off most every box when it comes to features, function, and asthetics. But the way the rack tynes are situated make it difficult to give that extra star.  It is the Achilles heal if this machine. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]",80,"June 26, 2020"
Clean,"I've had a Bosch in the past and got an L_ replacement after an electrial storm hit my home.  What a mistake but now we are back with Bosch and can notice an extreme improvement to our wash cycles.  Quiet, easy to install and in general a quality product.

great experience with previous model,"I had traditional dish washer which was making lots of noise when your turn it on. Even, I always start the dishwasher overnight and noise was waking me up.

I saw Bosch models in dishwasher aisle and read all of features ..etc. I bought SHP65T55UC (Bosch-500) in 2016. I believe this one is exactly same as mine but this is new generation. Mine is still working great.

What did I need?
1- Quick wash (less than 1hr)
2- Quietness (44dB is great)
3- hidden buttons (because of kids)
4- invisible heating coil. ( i had bad experience with visible heating core, spoon dropped on it and entire interior of machine melted down)
5- stainless steel inside ( no discoloring and making smell like plastic one)
6- delayed start. 

Did I get any trouble with machine, 
Yes, I did.
1- I paid extra and bought 2 years extra warranty. A few months later warranty expired, heating core (i forgot the part name, it looks like a snail) failed. It was not drying the dishes. I have reached Bosch and ordered replacement part. It took about 25 min to replace it and it is working great.
2- It does not dry the dishes 100%. my solution is when it done (after beeping), I keep open the door little bit and steam comes out. 
3- makes smell from time to time. but it is not mold smell, I believe it is related with detergent. Because I have to use septic safe detergent. 
4- inside of the door has some scratch, because i do not push the racks all the way end and door pushes them and made scratch ( it is my fault..! :) )

Nothing is perfect. But, it works great for me. In laws called me about an hour ago for asking the model number of my bosch dishwasher. They are planning to buy new one, especially quiet one. I recommended them bosch.",100,"June 26, 2020"

Our experience has been nothing but spectacular. Installation was well documented, and as it was a replacement, it definitely was no problem. It is whisper quiet - so much so that our kids have opened it several times while it was running, oblivious to that fact.

The layout is spacious and adjustable. It cleans spectacularly, and we have run it at least four times a week, so it is well used to this point with no issues. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]",100,"June 24, 2020"

Great dishwasher!,"We are glad we chose this dishwasher. Love the short rack for silverware and small items. The dishes always come out clean, even when I get a bit lazy with the rinse before I put them in. It's super quiet, which is important in our tile floor, open concept kitchen and family room. My only complaint is that we had to call the help desk to program the door to pop open at the end of the cycle. It was a selling point for this model so I'm surprised it didn't come pre-programmed. We did the installation ourselves so that might not have been a problem if we had hired it out. But that was dealt with pretty quickly, so no real complaints!

Bosch Dishwasher at Last,"I have wanted a bosch diswasher for years, but my old dishwasher just kept chugging along.  I moved to a new home and as fortune would have it the dishwasher did not work.  The owner was going to replace with the cheapest dishwasher he could find.  I offer the pay the difference to get the dish washer of my choice.  I looked at the Bosch 500 Series. The sleek outside appearance first attrached me. Now that I have been using this dishwasher for several months, I love it.  It cleans very well and is so quiet I have to go stand beside to hear if it is still washing.  The third shelf is great for large spoons and spatulas.  It also is great for small objects.  I would definitely recommend this Bosch dishwasher to my friends. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]",100,"June 24, 2020"

Quiet efficient dishwasher,"bought this dishwasher a few weeks ago and really like the air dry capability.  It seems to get plastics and other dishes dryer when ran at night.  The silverware/utensil tray is nice as it gets the utensils and small lids dryer and keeps them from flying around inside.  It does seem like I can't fit as many dishes in this dishwasher, but that could be because the designers wanted to clean and dry dishes more efficiently.  The floor light is nice, but some indication of time left with the door closed would be an improvement.  Setting/starting it was a learning experience as the dishwasher is meant to be hidden under the cabinets but my cabinets allow the buttons to be used while the door is shut, but the door has to be open to change settings or start it.  All in all, I like it. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]",80,"June 23, 2020"

My favorite dishwasher!,"We bought our first Bosch dishwasher several years ago during a kitchen remodel.  WE LOVED IT.  Hands down, it was the quietest, best dishwasher we had ever owned.  We downsized and moved a couple of years ago and the builder-grade dishwasher that came with the house was a big disappointment.  Two plus years later, we finally bought another Bosch - best decision ever!  I can't say enough about how well this dishwasher performs.  Do yourself a favor and buy a Bosch!

Great purchase,This dishwasher runs very quietly and cleans very well.  There are only two issues that are not as favorable.  One is that the door doesn't always pop open as it should at the end of the cycle which helps the dishes air dry.  The other issue is that the top pull-out rack makes it difficult to place glassware on the rack below as it interferes with the needed space.

Bosch User Feedback,"I thi nk Bosch made a big mistake with the design of this dishwasher.  The digit dispay is only on when the dishwasher door is open.  Therefore, you cannot tell where the dishwasher is in the cycle unless you open the door which then resets the digital display to the beginning of the cycle.  Why didn't you design it so that the digital display is on when the dishwasher is operating? [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]",60,"June 17, 2020"

Good dishwasher,"I have had this dishwasher now for a little over a month. So far I like it. It is extremely quiet. I really can't even tell that it is running except for the light red light projects on to my floor. The dishes come out very clean with no water marks and I am surprised at the capacity for it being a standard size dishwasher. It seems to hold a lot more than the one we replaced even though they are the same size. It is very sleek and modern looking. The stainless steel is is easy to clean with stainless steel cleaner. The only two things that are a negative about it is 1) the cycles are very long. A normal cycle takes about 2 1/2 hours.(Honestly, I am still uses to my old one from the 90's that would run through and be finished in about 30-45 mins. Not really a problem with the dishwasher, I am just not used to it yet). 2) It seems to have a slight smell when I open it. It is nothing that is very strong or overpowering. I can really only smell it when I lean down to put something in it when the door is open. It just smells like a collection of dirty dishes. Overall, I would definitely recommend this dishwasher for people who are looking to upgrade. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]",80,"June 17, 2020"

And they are sparkling clean without the feeling of dishwasher residue. The only thing that could be improved upon would be the adjustability of the bottom rack's prongs. Enough of them don't adjust down to accommodate some of our larger dishes without blocking the dish. Otherwise, we are very pleased!

The one down side and it really isn’t that big of a deal but I have it 4 stars out of 5 is that it really should dry the dishes better at this price point. We replaced a 15 year old dishwasher with this one and the old one dried the dishes I think better than this one does. Again not a huge deal for us but you would think it would do a better job since it’s new and at this price.

"No smells, quiet, cleans PB, no melting plastic","After 3 months it is time to write a review. First off, there are NO SMELLS emanating from the interior. I had read reviews with complaints of smells. I could not discern if the smell complaints were due to plastic interior, or reviewers wanting to tarnish Bosch’s reputation, as they all had same writing style. I had plastic interior DWs in past and never had smells. I have wanted Bosch appliances since 1970s, but believed they were too expensive. Kept purchasing more reasonably priced appliances such as GE, Kenmore, Frigidaire and Whirlpool. I did spring for an Amana fridge once. Decided after my last DW, a highly rated Consumers Reports Whirlpool that died at 3 year and 7 months, to go with a brand with great reliability. Fixing the Whirlpool DW would cost more than to replace as the heating element and the control panel were both shot. It did not make it to 7 years like my previous Kenmore. Then, in my research I learned appliances in the past 5 years have not been manufactured as they once were, more plastic parts to break and enclosed parts that no repair person could access. So, even if purchase another Kenmore probably won’t last as long. This Bosch DW is a similar model a relative has loved for 4 years, so with this recommendation I should like this as well. Having an enclosed heating element is great, no dishwasher safe plastic melts, even on the bottom rack. The stainless steel interior is nice looking and should not get cracks like a plastic interior. The racks configure nicely, can get all my assorted sizes of dishes, pans, drinkware positioned. This is the 1st DW I ever owned (and that is many years) that gets peanut butter off the butter knives, and any plates it is on. So quiet I cannot tell it is running, doesn’t interfere with TV in adjacent room (no walls between rooms). Drying cycle gets all dry except drinkware with indentations on top that water pools in. That is fine, easy to dry off those cups. I keep the door open about 3” so interior that might be wet after a wash, or dirty items will dry out and not form mold. My relative with a Bosch DW told me she never keeps door open, closes it completely and never had problems with mold and smells in 4 years. Still, I like to be sure everything dries. I have been keeping DW doors and washing machine doors open for years to dry out interiors and never had mold or smells. The DW drain basket and spray arms are easy to get at to clean if needed. Mine have not been dirty/clogged. I expect this DW to make it past 5 years (based on friends and relatives experiences), hope it gets to 7. I am going to post this same review on the Lowe’s site (store where I purchased) so more consumers can learn of this good product.

Wife Is Very Happy,"I don't always do everything right, but I managed to get this right. When we were looking to replace our 15 year old dishwasher, I found this one. After reading reviews, reading test results published by a consumer product testing organization, and speaking to happy Bosch dishwasher owners, there was no doubt which brand we were going to buy. The quality of the appliance was obvious as we shopped and inspected the other brands available. 

We decided on this model because of the features and appearance. I enjoy watching my wife load the dishwasher because she actually smiles like it is fun. She is also pleased with the washcycle options available. The air dry feature has worked great for our needs. And, we use the rinse liquid which has resulted in dishes, glasses and other items free of spots and other water marks. 

The install was easy, but I have previously installed dishwashers. The past experience helped and made me appreciate the Bosch appliance even more. The power cord, water line and drain were straight forward. I needed to level it in the space and found that to be a simple process. 

We were a bit concerned about the need to clean out a filter. None of our other dishwashers had this feature. But the process is simple and I like knowing the drain path is clear. We keep the garbage disposal drain free of food parts and pieces, which is a good idea always.

The more we use the dishwasher the more we personally find why this brand is consistently rated so high. My daughter is intentionally finding problems with her brand dishwasher (which still works) so she can justify buying a Bosch. She'll have one soon I'm sure. 

Anyways, I highly recommend this dishwasher. So far so great. Plus my wife is very happy. For me that's the best part. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]",100,"June 12, 2020"
Happy to have made the switch!,"We were lookig for a mid-price range quality dishwasher to be an upgrade to our prior unit. Several friends and relatives recommened we go with Bosch. We knew of their reputation for being quiet diswashers and found one with several other features that attracted us. The 3rd drawer at the top and  a setting that opens the door at the end of the cycle for even better drying sold us. We have had it for just over three months now and have been very pleased with its operation. The unit is very quiet, it has all of the features (and more) that we might want and, most importantly, our dishes come out  clean. We made an excellent choice going with Bosch!

Shpm65z55n,After running my new dishwasher for a month I have to say honestly that I am not 100% satisfied. The one thing I find that it does not hold as much as my previous dishwasher and I don't think it cleans as well as my old dishwasher. I'm still trying to figure out the best setting to use but sometimes my dishes still come out with food on them even though I'm doing everything the correct way. Another issue I am having is that it seems to take a long time to do its cycles. I am very happy with how quiet it is and the look is perfect and it fits in nicely with the rest of my kitchen. It's still a learning curve for me but eventually I hope to find the best way to use it. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.],60,"June 12, 2020"

Pleased so far,Very quiet.  Not that hard to select appropriate program once I read complete manual on line.  Everything gets cleaned but some plastics still have some wetness after cycle completed.  Avoid touching stainless front panel.  Marks up very easily but cleans up well. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.],80,"June 10, 2020"

The third shelf is awesome, and it is a very quiet machine.  I am surprised the latch feels a little flimsy, just a plastic clicking shut instead of a metal latch, but it is made to auto-open, so maybe that is why.  Hopefully it lasts for a long time.  All in all I love this and am very happy with the purchase, and expect it to last for many years.",100,"June 10, 2020"

Great dishwasher! - only wish space was better,"This is the greatest dishwasher I've owned! (Never mind the fact that it's only the second one I've owned too) 
It is extremely quiet... the sound of the drain is actually the loudest part, and that's due to my garbage disposal cover not being on correctly. 
The dishes always come out spotless and clean. 
My only complaint (the fifth star in the review) is the space. I do like the three drawer idea as it keeps the silverware flat and tucked in the top, but what is the purpose of the side tray on the bottom drawer? You can't really put any spatulas or long mixing spoons as they prohibit the jet spinning thing to spin. So, I typically take it out and it gives me a few extra square inches for actual dishes. As for the height of the second drawer, I can't really put a standard size dinner plate in it without it hitting the top drawer. 
I feel like these are designed for European dishes...
All-in-all, I would absolutely recommend this dishwasher! [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]",80,"June 9, 2020"

Loving the new dishwasher,We love the super efficient and thorough clean this dishwasher is performing.  It is also the super quiet which was critical because it’s 10’ from our boys’ bedroom door.  The adjustable trays are very helpful.  The only critique is that you have to make sure to set auto dry open so it will open when complete.  And we would prefer a nice surface mounted stainless bar handle on the door or even a slim Euro style pull on the doors top instead of the recessed door handle.

Happy with product,"This unit was 20% off at the time. Other dishwashers were 10% off. Read reviews of this model dishwasher and all were good. Unit is quiet does a good job cleaning. We like the auto pop open door at end of cycle to help facilitate drying without the extra heating element. Dishes are clean and dry. Shines a red light on floor during cycle. Quiet enough to run thru wash cycle while watching tv. Little more expensive than other brands. But I have never been disappointed buying quality over price.

Great functionality in a high quality dishwasher!,"replaced a 5 year old top model kitchenaid. We love the 3 racks with many modular adjustments that are quick and easy to do on the fly. Its is QUIET!! Thank God there is a little indicator light that shows up on the floor or else I would have no idea if it was running. Haha. Love that there is no exposed heating element in the bottom. Very clean and dries amazingly well. There are a lot of customizable settings that are all useful. The part i was most nervous about using was the auto pop open door. Once I saw how it worked I have zero fears and really like that it can pop open to vent and dry the dishes to perfection. It is a sprong loaded door so all it does is release the door and it pops open on its own. No moving push rods or anything which makes me confident in its durability.

Wicked clean in Silence,"To say this washer is quiet is innacurate.  It is silent. Yet it is running and the result is crystal clean dishes.

Love my Bosch 500 dishwasher,"We've had our new dishwasher a couple mo the and so far, we love it!  It replaced an 11 year old GE that came with our house. Hopefully this one will last that long or longer!  I love the sleek design, having three drawers, stainless steel interior, and being able to customize all the settings. Putting all our silverware on the top shelf saves so much room on the bottom shelf for larger items and overflow from the middle shelf. Not having a bottom heating element has saved me from hand washing larger plastic lids and cups. The adjustable middle shelf is also a plus. I can easily change it when needed. Customer service is also great. I had a question and they were very helpful! [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]",100,"June 4, 2020"

Replaced dying LG Dishwasher,"The Bosch has been in for 2 months now and it's an improvement over the old LG model in every possible way. The 3-rack system is great, although I was skeptical of the need for the extra rack. The quick wash option if useful when in a hurry. Since our kitchen is essentially part of the living room the quiet operation (rated at 44 db) is a blessing. The direct plug in instead of hard-wiring seems safer to me as well. Very satisfied!

Best Dishwasher I've Ever Had in 40 years!,We have been so totally amazed at how quiet this dishwasher is! You really can't tell it's on unless you look at the red light on the floor! The 3rd rack is so useful for large utensils. I love that you can put plastic containers on any level and there is plenty of room for everything. We are a family of six and I can fit all our dishes and silverware for a full day in this dishwasher. If I had anything negative to say it would be that I like to put the forks in with tines down and it's a bit difficult to do this with a lot of siverware in the caddy. The only other thing is that sometimes the dishes are not completely dry when I unload them. Overall this is by far the best dishwasher we've ever owned.

The ONLY issue we have with it so far is that it is SO QUIET we forget it is running (even though the light is on the floor) & open it to put dishes in it.

[This review was collected as part of a promotion.]",80,"June 2, 2020"
Very Disappointed,"I have had this dishwasher for about two weeks and feel I made a mistake in buying it for four reasons.  1). Because of the way the prongs are slanted on the middle and bottom rack, you are forced to place the dishes in a certain way/pattern, or they don't get clean. Bosch markets how great it is to be able to put in 16 place settings, but the reality is everyday use includes bowls, pans and pots that are not uniformly shaped. The prongs prevent some of these from being loaded in a way that will get them clean.  I was told the prongs are placed that way because the water flow is designed to only hit the dishes in a certain pattern.  The result is the number of items I can load are significantly less than all the previous dishwashers that had prongs that pointed straight up.  I now must hand wash items I would have normally put in the dishwasher because they can’t fit in properly to get clean unless they are the only thing on the rack. 2). Because of the third rack, taller glasses cannot fit on the second rack which is crazy because the second rack has a plastic piece that holds stemware in place.  This only works if you have really short stem glasses. If you have anything other than shorter glasses, they will not fit on the middle rack.  Small salad bowls and such do not fit well on that rack either because those prongs are slanted as well.  3). I feel mislead on the third rack.  Apparently, you cannot put anything in there that isn't perfectly flat because there is a spinning arm that shoots out water but we can't see it and if anything is there that is not flat, it gets caught on the spinning arm and those things don't get clean.  4). Lastly, if you don't use the Auto Air feature, your dishes come out sopping wet.  But to use the Auto Air feature, it takes 3 hours and 15 minutes to complete.  They are still wet but better than if you use the regular 2.5 hour cycle.  Also be sure to turn off the dishwasher after every use or the control panel stays on.

Bosch 500 Series Dishwasher,"Like it real well after a problem during start up.  Apparently some water used during testing before shipment had drained somewhere it should not have been and got error message saying it was leaking and needed servicing.  I removed the clean out screen etc and reinstalled and error message disappeared and tried again and got same message and something was running in bottom of dishwasher.
Did the same again two more times and on the second attempt started as it should and been working great ever since.  Don't know if the washer was turned over during handling and let water go where it should not.  Some gurgled out of side opening on left side on the last attempt.  Since then all is great just getting used to new dish placement rack as replaced prior Bosch that I had for many years and did a great job.  Glassware doing great with rinse additive.

Great dishwasher,"We love our new dishwasher! It cleans stuck on food great and dries perfectly. I like the utensil tray on top and the versatile adjustments you can make to the top 2 racks. I think the bottom rack is difficult to effficiently use space if you have a lot of bowls and plates. We have 7 in our house so we load a large amount each day. Overall, I would definitely buy again.

The dishwasher, though is FANTASIC. Insanely quiet and really gets the dishes clean as long as you use the finish gel pacs. Do NOT use powder...we did that initially and the dishes were a clouded up mess. This unit replaced another Bosch that was 20 years old.

Love the third drawer and light on the floor,"Since the day my new dishwasher was installed, I have been completely satisfied with my new dishwasher.  My husband actually helps me unload it because of the third drawer.  This beautiful machine is so quiet that I do not notice when it is finished; my husband said to me, just look at the floor, if the red light is not shining on the floor, it is finished.  My dishes are well cleaned and dried.  Truly, it is an amazing and refreshing change from the Whirlpool that I had for less than 2 years, with two breakdowns.  I recommend Bosch to anyone I know who is dishwasher shopping.  There is just no machine that compares in being solid, quiet. efficient and nice to look at as well as to load and unload.

Best dishwasher I’ve ever had!,"I was reluctant to pay the premium price for my Bosch dishwasher, but after using it for a few weeks I can say that it was worth it. 

1. It cleans really well. Have not had any dishes come out that needed extra cleaning. 
2. It's crazy quiet. My significant other and I no longer have to wait until we go to bed to run the dishwasher since the old one would drown out the TV! I love the little red light that turns on when it's running.

Classic German engineering,Cleans very efficiently and extremely quiet.  Plenty of racks and options to load different types of dishes.  Love the third rack for silverware.  Sleek looking appearance.  The only issue I've experienced is it sometimes resets to a run cycle when you close the door even though you didn't push the button.  It's a simple fix of just pushing the on/off button.  I hope it doesn't damage the electronic circuit board over time.,100,"May 27, 2020"

Disappointed,"We shopped around a lot. Finally, we settled on this model based on great features and reasonable price. 
Unfortunately, we didn't listen to some reviews that warned of weak lower dish racks not being able to hold dishes and stay on track. After less than 3 months, we can't push in the lower rack without it falling down out of the track. This also prevents the door from opening automatically to dry at the end of the cycle.
Contacting customer support to, hopefully, fix the problem. Will update my review to let you know how it goes...",20,"May 22, 2020"

Not what I thought,"White the dishwasher is great in cleaning, I'm extremely disappointed in the system's drying process.

I've gone through all the troubleshooting recommendations and still no change - even changed when I wash the dishes, waiting different times to remove the load - no changes.  I wish I was told that another model had the dry boost cycle.  Unfortunately the dishwasher was installed just days before the Covid lockdown so there is no option to exchange the machien.

Best dishwasher ever,"I honestly cannot imagine that a better dishwasher exists, unless it loads and unloads dishes by itself. I have owned numerous high-end, pricey dishwashers over the years, but this machine, very reasonably priced, is by far the best I have ever had. I have never had dishes this clean, and we have intentionally put this machine to the test to find its limitations. So far, there don't seem to be any. It is whisper quiet in our open concept home, a necessity, and opens itself at the end of the cycle so that dishes are completely dry when I go to unload it. This is also a great feature to reduce potential for mold growth in the machine, another critical need for my family. Finally, the one selling point for me was the auto water leak sensor. This machine will never ruin your wood floors or flood your kitchen leading to a mold disaster. The entire machine sits in a huge pan that will catch any water leak and will automatically shut off the machine if water is detected. Brilliant design, and what peace of mind! Why aren't all dishwashers made this way? Because they are not Bosch. This machine far exceeds all of my expectations. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]",100,"May 20, 2020"

Excellent Dishwasher,"I installed our new Bosch 500 series dishwasher about a month ago and so far, we couldnt be happier. This dishwasher does an outstanding job of cleanding AND drying dishes. I was hesitant at first since these do not have a dedicated drying heating element, but my reservations were unfounded. I do love that we are able to run this at any time of day now as it is so quite! Our previous dishwasher (2000's Maytag) had to be run at night due to the high noise level. Unfortuanly ours did have a couple small scratches on the side of the door, but I was able to get a partial credit back from the vendor and I touched up with white paint. We did pay quite a bit more than other brands, so hopefully it will be reliable long term. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]",100,"May 19, 2020"
Horrible Experience,We had to call for maintenance after only 2 weeks of having this dishwasher.  It is loud and often needs to be restarted after an initial turn on.

Designers need to change several features,"From all the reviews I have read on this dishwasher, I expected more. The first thing I noticed during installation was the plastic inlet valve hose attachment. My old one was brass and the water line easily threaded onto it. This plastic easily cross threads and is the number one complaint from the repair tech. The second issue, dishes never completely dry. Although the ""benefit"" is a higher efficiency washer to cover up the excuse of wet dishes. A heating element is really required. If you want to towel dry your dishes as you unload, this is your washer. The top rack is almost useless. It impedes the loading capability of the second rack and I have taken dirty utensils out after a wash cycle. Another quirk is that after a wash cycle ends and then upon opening the washer, the wash cycle automatically enables. You have to turn off the washer, when this should be the default. Who's going to immediately reload the washer and start it? Lastly, the bottom rack spacing for dishes seems to be off. If you load plates into the washer on either left or right sides, theres no room for plates to be placed side by side. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]",40,"May 17, 2020"
Awesome,"We replaced a 30 year old dishwasher with the Bosh 500, and it is like moving from the horse and buggy to the jet age. It took a little bit of time to learn how to operate it, but now that we have the hang of it we love this dishwasher. Everything comes out sparkling clean, and the feature that opens the door when the wash was done is really useful. So glad we decided to pay a little more for a quality machine.

Okay dishwasher but not overly impressed,"It is not easy to put dishes in with the way it has the spikes which I've never experienced before. It's very quiet which is pleasant. It seems I must use some kind of extra rinse aid as I'm using a multi clean pod that has a rinse aid but I still get spots on silverware and dishes and that's just embarrassing when I think someone else might think they aren't clean. I like the LED on floor to tell me it's running but it's not super clear why sometimes I set controls and shut the door and the light is blinking instead of solid which means it isn't going to start so I have to reset and restart and I still get blinking light sometimes so that's annoying. Idk what's wrong but I got to mess with for a while and it's happened more than a few times since I've bought it in March, it's mid May now. Probably my inability to Tetris in my dishes and bowls very easily like I feel I could do in the past is the most annoying aspect so far. Glad I live alone. If I had more dishes or when the holidays come, I'm worried about that. I can adjust the prongs on bottom but I haven't messed with that. It's probably amazing and it's user error issues. I'm happy but not blown away. I'll be blown away if it's still working in 4 years. Definitely the one type of kitchen appliance that I have had to buy again and agian.

Loving our Bosch 500 series,"We have been using our SHPM65Z55N for a month now. We researched dishwashers for weeks before making our purchase. It is everything we hoped it would be. We use the Auto cycle with the sanitize option. Dishes always come out clean and dry. We typically hand wash most plastic so we can't speak to how dry plastic gets. We love the versatility of how it loads and we love the upper rack for our silverware. On top of all this, we can actually have a conversation in the kitchen now and not have to compete with the dishwasher. It is so quiet!

I really like the way this dishwasher looks, and also like the way to set up is inside the dishwasher. Most importantly, it does a wonderful job of cleaning dishes.  The only issue I've had with this dishwasher so far is stop the pure air setting doesn't work most of the time. This is the setting that will open the door once it's done to let the steam out and dry the dishes naturally. However, most of the time, the door is still closed.

We bought it to replace a 14 year old dishwasher that was quiet years ago but has since gotten very noisy and was not cleaning very well. This Bosch is a dream. We can now hear the TV in our open floor plan home even when the dishwasher is running. I love the 3rd tier top rack to lay down larger cuttlery and small lids, etc. And the way the racks are configured leaves room for everything.

Good,Thought it would be life changing since this was my first new expensive dishwasher. It is amazingly quiet and cleans well but still leaves food on plastic.  Still trying to decide if the price was worth the difference. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.],80,"May 14, 2020"
"So, so quiet!",We just purchased this within the last month. I love the sleek style--I got the black stainless to blend with my black cabinets--controls are on the top instead of front. My favorite feature is how quiet it is. My old one was so noisy I had to wait until we went to bed to start it so we could hear the tv. It also gets the dishes really clean. The only reason I didn't give it five stars is because I was spoiled with my other dishwashers having the silverware basket in the door. That was so much more convenient instead of having to pull out the bottom tray to put in silverware. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.],80,"May 14, 2020"
LOVE LOVE LOVE IT,I love my new dishwasher! After living with a noisy Kitchenaid for years I couldn't be more pleased with my Bosch. It is extremely quiet ant the dishes are spotless. I have never not rinsed my dishes before loading the dishwasher so I was quite surprised how clean they came out. It took a while to get the hang of loading it effectively. I wish there was one more small utensil compartment. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.],100,"May 13, 2020"

Could be lots better,"When our Whirlpool dish washer stopped working, we purchased the series 500 Bosch Dishwasher hearing all good things about it.  We are very disappointed.  A coulple of main issues.  The slotting of the lower try does not have spaceing for big oven cooking dishes.  This causes either using more space to put these into the diswasher, or not haveing the proper spacing for other dishes.  The no heating elements to dry dishes also causes some dishes to come out wet, even when left in the alloted amount of time.  The third try is handy and the only saving grace for this unit.

Truly disappointing,"I purchased this Bosch dishwasher in August to replace an older, adequate, but loud GE dishwasher.  Yes, it is sleek and much quieter, and as a highly rated brand, I was willing to spend more money.  Mistake.  At this point it hasn't been worth the cost.  The biggest issue is the filter system, as it needs to be cleaned every month or two in order to keep the pump emptying during the wash cycle.  Not a problem for the first four months, but now the lack of draining has happened three times over the past four months.  If it's not cleaned, the pump doesn't empty and has to be manually drained, filters cleaned and a small plastic part removed and replaced. This is not an easy process, you need to remove the bottom shelf, maneuver in the dish water to find the drain, and remove 1 delicate plastic piece that you have to use a spoon to pull out. This has to be repeated every time, sometimes more than twice if I want the dishwasher to function and my dishes to actually get cleaned. Bosch has been helpful with suggestions and now, the third time, has sent out a work order for a service call.  As it is still under warranty I won't be paying, but as I'm nearing the first full year, I guess I'll be buying the Bosch warranty plan which they have offered any number of times.  Not instilling much confidence in the product.",40,"May 11, 2020"

Quiet and Plenty of Room,"We bought this dishwasher because our previous dishwasher  was making so much noise, it was running us out of the room.  Our Bosch dishwasher is very quiet.  If it were not for an occasional dish clanking, we would not even know it was running (except for the red light shining on the floor).
The one thing we did not expect was how much room it has.  My husband asked if I had gotten rid of some silverware because we were alway running out of clean forks.  I told him that the dishwasher seemed to hold more dishes and we were not washing as frequently.  That is a plus.  Also, I wasn't sure how much I would use the 3rd rack (top).  It is great for utensils and knives, as well as small dishes.
We have been using the 60 minute cleaning cycle.  The only time we had dishes not come out clean was when something blocked the water spinner arm.  That was our fault.  
We are happy with our purchase and would do it again. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]",100,"May 10, 2020"

Bosch 500 Series Dishwasher,"My wife and I invested several hours of research prior to making a decision on which Dishwasher to purchase. We've purchased several dishwashers over the many years we have been together, unfortunately all ended up in disappointment shortly after the purchase. The Bosch 500 Series Dishwasher is that purchase we were looking for. Bosch is all it claims to be. Between all the features and its proformance thus far, we couldn't be happier with our investment. I have always been a fan of, ""You get what you pay for"". The Bosch name definitely validates that for me. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]",100,"May 9, 2020"

First Bosch Dishwasher,This is our first Bosch dishwasher.  We have only had it installed for one month but have been impressed.  The fist thing we noticed was how quite it was.  You barely can hear it when it runs.  The last diswasher was a Maytag and it was suppose to be the one of the quitest ones and compared to the Bosch it was a bigger difference.  Another thing is the silverware tray on the top rack is different and takes a little getting used to but it seems to work out so far.  We will see how reliable it is.  We are tough on dishwasher and run it at least every day. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.],100,"May 9, 2020"

Manual needs,"I think the dishwasher is great at washing, but the machine smells bad (not food smell and not food in the catcher). I called in and was told that they know about this new washer smell and that all of them smell for some reason but that this will go away eventually. 

The manual leaves a lot to be desired.  I could not get any  the various settings to work.  It was stuck on ""Auto.""  Nothing in manual about that.  Customer service was able to guide me how to reset it.  Seems that would be in the manual and it is not.  And, it does not tell me how to fill the Jet Dry compartment. I had to ask friends who have that option since my old machine had a small compartment that you filled each time you did a load.  Also, the salesman told me to put Pods in the area at the front of the upper tray, but there is a compartment in the door.  The manual does not say if both are acceptable or just one.  

Also, on ""Air Dry"" the door pops open on its own, I guess to ""air dry.""  I didn't know if that was normal or not.  And, once it popos open, there is what looks like a timer on the top panel and I have to hit the ""off"" button when I close the door. What is that all about?  Nothing in the manual about all this. Bottomline, the machine works great, but the manual needs revamped badly! [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]",80,"May 8, 2020"

Dishwasher review,"I recently purchased a Bosch  to replace my Viking dishwasher.  Before my purchase, I investigated several different brands. With my wife, I went to many different stores looking at each one. I considered the different options on each. Some had 3rd racks that lifted, some had drop down separators. Many had different cycles. So it came down to 3 different manufacturers. The price of all three was pretty much the same.   So what sealed the deal on Bosch?  It was NOT the salemen's opinion, but rather repairmen's opinions. Each one I talked with said in their opinon Bosch was in a class of their own. Most said they had very few repairs on Bosch dishwashers. They recommended that I purchase one if I wanted a quality product. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]",100,"April 29, 2020"

Very quiet and pleasant device,"It generally works well, the dishes get cleaned and the more or less dry while using Air Vent feature. There is a little concern with an indication of active status if a time delay is used. Basically, if we loaded the washer and scheduled it to run in 4 hours, there is no indication of that. So another person in the house might open the door to put more dishes and that resets the previous setting, so ultimately dishes don't get washed while expected.

We specifically were looking for a washer with physical pushbuttons, because a lot of modern sensor style buttons fail for our fairly ordinary fingers. This dishwasher has stellar buttons! It feels great to push it and to know that your intent is delivered to the system. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]",80,"April 29, 2020"

Best Dishwasher Yet,"This is certainly the most expensive Dishwasher we have purchased and you get what you pay for. We did the rounds of budget dishwashers, some good and some not so good, but this one blows them all away. It's efficient, quiet, and cleans very well. I was suspicious about the third rack at first, now we don't even use the utensil caddie. Highly recommend this product. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]",100,"April 28, 2020"

Best dishwasher I’ve ever owned!,I purchased a competitor group when I moved into my house nearly five years ago.  The dishwasher went bad and needed replaced.  Very frustrating.   Of course it would have been nice to go with the same brand so all appliances matched but given the information my repairman related that would not be a smart solution.   He told me he works on many of that brands dishwashers and they have similar issues.  So... research brought me to Bosch and I'm grateful.  I love how quiet it is because I have an open floor plan AND can't believe how much cleaner the dishes are.  I also appreciate the feature of air drying instead of heat drying--  I am a forever Bosch fan! [This review was collected as part of a promotion.],100,"April 26, 2020"

Quiet as can be and the glassware sparkles but...,I have used this DW for a month. I have cleaned the filter 3 times. I am using up my old supply of Cascade before the recommended Finish tabs. Two times I have opened the dooor after the entire cycle and smelled cheese. The first time there were small globs of sour cream on the floor of the unit. The second time nothing cheesy was washed. I sponged out the residual water below the filter when I cleaned it. Next wash--no odor. I also find small bits of rust in the top tray on my stainless knives. Hope to find solutions to these issues.

The quietest dishwasher ever,We have been using our Bosch dishwasher for about two months and still can't believe how quiet it is.  Thanks to the Bosch designer that thought to put the red light shinning on the floor.  Without the light we would not know when the dishwasher is on.  Not only does the bosch eliminate the annoying noise but it does an amazing job cleaning the dishes.  Rinsing dishes is a thing of the past because everything comes out clean.  The airdry feature is unbelivablely convienient. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.],100,"April 25, 2020"

Quiet guest in the kitchen,"We have never had a dishwasher as quiet as this one.  We have no wall between the kitchen and the living room and that is why we chose the Bosch dishwasher that was famous for its sound ratings.  Sure enough, we can hardly hear it running, and we can enjoy watching TV in the evening while it runs without a sound.  I also does a fabulous job of washing the dishes by the way.  The only negative I have noticed is that a few times right after we installed it, there was a problem getting it to start.  But it seems to have settled in now and hasn't been a problem lately.  One more thing worth mentioning, don't ever open the door to add one more fork or a glass or something, it does not like to restart again.  Had to turn it off and back on several times to try to get it to clear and re-start.  Quite frustrating! [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]",80,"April 24, 2020"

makes dish washing a breeze.,"I had my new Bosch installed just before the COVID19 lockdown.  I couldn't be more pleased with it's performance!

Love the Bosch 500 Series,"My wife and I had our old dishwasher go out about 18 months ago and had done our research before settling on the Bosch 500 Series based on brand reliability, user reviews and the features this dishwasher provides.  We had it installed in early March of 2020 and have been very pleased with it.  With the COVID-19 pandemic and everyone staying at home more we run the dishwasher every day and haven't had an issue or complaint.  We love the loading options the adjustable middle rack provides and the 3rd rack for silverware and long utensils, it works out great.  It is so very quiet too.  I can hardly tell it is running unlike my previous dishwasher.  The dishes dry very well, including glasses.  
The common complaints I had read were about dishes not fully drying and a bad odor from the inside of some folks dishwashers.  We use the AutoAir feature which opens the door when the cycle is complete which I find nice so that probably helps with drying.  As for any odors, we noticed a slight odor developing in the tub if we weren't good about rinsing off our silverware beforehand but if we rinse them before loading then we haven't had any issues.  
The only other thing to be aware of is the height of the dishwasher, it is a bit taller than most and as a result we had to remove a few tiles from out kitchen floor to get it to drop in under the counter but I was aware of that going in so not a big deal for me.  Overall I couldn't be happier with my purchase right now. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]",100,"April 24, 2020"

I LOVE how clean it gets our dishes, love the 3rd rack (secret rack, to quote my grandson), love that there's no visible heating coil, love how quiet it is, and I could go on and on!  The only drawback, so far, is that it takes 2 hours and 9 minutes for the Auto cycle, and even longer for special cycles.  It does a wonderful job on dishes, but takes a long time to do so.

Bosch 500 Series Dishwasher,"We purchased this dishwasher after our 2004 GE dishwasher gave up!  It's taken a while to get used to the new one, but it's getting better each time we use it.  It really cleans the dishes well without scraping and we like the pop out door when it's finished.  The third top tray is a plus and very useful.  It came with a quick guide manual but we ended up printing 50 pages of the full manual to understand the whole operation, and a few calls to Bosch customer service.  We aren't as happy with the silverware basket and see on your website you have  several others, but not sure if they work in our model.  Also the second time we ran it with a full load, I pulled out the bottom tray to unload and two of the wheels on the right side fell off.  I guess you can order  more of those too.

"Very quiet, but wish it dried better.","I waited a bit after purchasing so I could really get a sense of how this dishwasher performed. I am generally happy with it. It took a while to figure out the best way to load it as it is very different inside compared to my old GE Monogram dishwasher. Wine glasses fit extremely well in the Monogram along one side on the top shelf, but to do so in the Bosch, I would have to take out the third upper shelf, which I like having. So, from now on it's wine glasses washed by hand. The Bosch is pretty quiet, which I like a lot: much more so than my old one. My biggest gripe (and I think I had read this before buying) is that, even with the dryer selection on, some items are always wet once the cycle is complete. Overall, I am glad I bought this dishwasher and hope to have it for many years to come. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]",80,"April 20, 2020"

Good Dishwasher Poor Organization,We replaced an ASKO dishwasher with this dishwasher. It cleans really well. The internal organization and layout of the dishwasher is not ideal. There isn't enough room for taller glasses on the top shelf. We have broken several when trying to close the drawer. We then have to put larger glasses in the bottom drawer but then they are in the way of the plates. I also don't think there is a lot of room to put large plates in the bottom drawer or to put bowls in the top shelf. The silverware drawer is really nice to unload and not so fun to load. It is a little slow. Also there isn't a lot of room for larger utensils like rubber spatulas or regular spatulas. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.],60,"April 16, 2020"

Noisy,"There is nothing quiet about this machine, just got it and had service tech out to solve the problem about the loud noise, he said its the jet of water hitting the dishes.

No need to look anywhere else!,"Love the. Bosch I recently purchased for so many reasons!   Quiet-you don't even know it's running.   3rd rack for cutlery-  Genius!!!

A Dream of a Dishwasher,"We had to replace our three-year-old dishwasher, and we were not happy about that fact, so we did a good bit of research and settled on this Bosch.  Fossil that I am, I never knew dishwashers now came with a third drawer for utensils and plastic lids, etc.  I also wasn't aware one could buy one with a special drying cycle.  These two features, plus the excellent cleaning ability of the Bosch, have made me fall in love with my new dishwasher!  I love the fact that the silverware can be arranged by type in the handy third drawer; I put spoons, forks together, etc.  When it comes time to put them away, I'm able to grab a bunch of them by their handles and put them away in their drawer, a much more sanitary process than fishing them out of basket by the end that actually touches your food.  I didn't know I could fall in love with a kitchen appliance, but I am kind of head over heels in love with this one. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]",100,"April 15, 2020"

Is it working?,"In looking for a new dishwasher, the two primary factors we looked for was space and performace of the wash-cycle. Buying the Bosch machine far exceeded those factors. Not only was there space, yes a 3rd rack for the big long spoons/ladels and knives, but we never ever heard it working except for the red light on the flow. Once the wash was complete, it was so refreshing to not only get clean plates and utensils, but dry ones too!!!! [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]",100,"April 15, 2020"

Update on New Bosch,"We purchased this Bosch product mainly for the quality and quiet ratings. We have not been disappointed. It took a while to pick up on the way to operate the dishwasher, not sure at first if this was due to our ineptitude or some lack of clarity on the part of the instructions. FInally figured out that the door needed to be open to program the cycle. Inside the washer, we've had to get used to the knives/forks rack. A little clunky to load. Top washer doesn't seem to hold tall wine glasses, so assume all those must be loaded on the bottom. Huge capacity, and getting used to ""remembering"" the third ""top"" drawer. Deinitely as quiet as rated, and we love that aspect. A very good cleaning cycle on Auto which should handle most any load. A product we are very happy to have purchased.

Outstanding!,"We have a 599 Series Dishwasher and it exceeds all expectations.  With an open kitchen / dining room / living room we thought the noise would be something we would have to have to live will.  But it is so quiet, we don't know when it is on.

DISHWASHER performance,"It is a very quiet dishwasher. But  a pretty good job on cleaning. The top utensil tray is ok not great. We just put utensils in the silverware holder. It's a good one and we like the controls. The air dry feature, which opens the door after the cycle is done, doesn't always open. That's why I would give it 4 to 4 1/2 stars.

Dependable,"We have been using this new dishwasher almost everyday with the family stuck at home and it has perfomed great. The dishes and silverware are spotless and clean as the day they were purchased. With no heating element, we are expecting a longer term savings compared to the previous dishwasher which consumed unecessary resources via the heating element to dry the items within the washer. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]",100,"April 14, 2020"
Dries the dishes just fine!,"I needed to replace a leaking Kenmore, which had the heated dry function.  I was reluctant to purchase a Bosch because it lacked heated dry.  Almost all reviews of Bosch dishwashers were great, so it was a tough decision.  So based on scads of great reviews, and the available features, we took the plunge.

Drying is not a problem.  The air dry function works well.  A bowl with steep sides may retain a bit of water if washed on its side.  And, of course, the tops of cups often have a bit of water.  Otherwise, the dishes and glasses come out dry and sparkling.  My wife noticed the difference between the Bosch and our old Kenmore immediately.

The only thing I really don't like is the silverware basket.  I don't think our flatware is any wider than normal, but it takes some effort to seat these utensils in the basket.  I much prefer the top drawer in which you lay the flatware on its side.  This makes it much easier to remove and put away.  One reviewer suggested keeping the old Kenmore basket and using it instead.  I wish I had!  A friend bought a 
Bosch a week after we did.  We suggested they keep their old basket, and they thanked us for it.

This is a small thing.  Otherwise, an excellent dishwasher.  We're very happy with it. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]",100,"April 14, 2020"

BEST PURCHASE WE'VE MADE IN A LONG TIME!,"We have had our Bosch dishwasher for about a month and are now comfortable to provide a review. 

Over the years we've had a variety of different dishwashers and have had mixed results, mostly poor,  with them all. Prior issues have been included poor cleaning, staining and reliability. The dishwasher the Bosch replaced had all these issues. We did some research and Bosch seemed to be one of the highest rated in all reviews, so we decided to purchase one.

This is the absolute best dishwasher we have ever had, by far. The ease of use, being extremely quiet, the variety of cycle options and build quality put us at ease. But most importantly, it actually cleans the dishes, which in our book makes it a best buy! The dishes come out sparkling and everything we have thrown at it is handled with ease no fuss, no muss. We have actually cycled all our dishes and utensils through a wash cycle or two and just about everything comes out looking like new. 

While slightly higher priced, we are confident this will suit our needs for years to come. Well done Bosch, you have new converts! [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]",100,"April 12, 2020"
So quiet!,Glad the floor laser light was a feature...this dishwasher is so quiet you need the light to know it is running.

500 Series dishwasher,Have been using for about a month and a half. Overall performs as expected. Does require acclimating to how to load compared to our prior dishwasher (Kenmore).

Great Dishwasher complicated controls,"Most of us like labels on buttons which states what the machine will do.  In an attempt to use a few buttons do an amazing number of things the designers have made this Bosch's controls far too complicated.  To put this criticism in perspective, I have a PhD and have taught engineering for nearly 40 years.  If you can figure out the controls, it is a great very quiet dishwasher.

Amazing Dishwasher,"This is the first dishwasher I have had that hasn't been disappointing. I love how quiet it is. I also love how I can adjust the middle rack up and down to fit larger items.

Finally!!!,"After our recent kitchen makeover we decided to buy a Bosch dishwasher as we'd been left disappointed by past companies. We couldn't be any happier with our new dishwasher. Several key reasons for my 5 star review would be how quiet this machine is, how well it cleans and what we like to call the Grannies Attic:  the little top rack for small items and ease of use!  This dishwasher is so quiet you have to be right up on top of it to know it's on. We opted for this model as it fit perfectly in the space we had and could not use anything unless it was a flush front. I'm so glad as I was afraid that if we didn't purchase the very top of the line it might not meet our needs. Thank you Bosch!  We love our dishwasher!!!

I love this dishwasher!,"My previous dishwasher(another brand), broke down after only 3 years, so all through the 2019 holiday season and until March I handwashed dishes for between 3 and 8 people...UGH!  I hadn't done that since being a kid with 6 siblings.  I love my new Bosch dishwasher! Not only are the dishes spit-spot clean, but you have to double check to see if it is running at all because it is SO quiet.  The first load I ran did not dry at all and I was worried that I might have to send it back, but after re-reading the manual, I tried the Auto Air cycle and things were nearly perfectly dry the next morning, but remember the door pops open so don't be alarmed.  
When COVID19 hit, I started using the Steralize setting along with the Auto Air cycle and the dishes are totally dry, however, it does take a bit longer to cycle.  Usually I set it on the Normal cycle along with the Auto Air and Steralize to save water, since at times only 3 of us are at home so the loads are lighter.  The silverware tray is a time saver when it comes to sorting silverware and makes putting silverware away a breeze.  Thank you for your fine product.

My Bosch dishwasher,"Based on sound level, cleanliness water consumption and cacacity, I would give this unit a 5 star rating. My only problem with this unit is trying to figure out the settings. When I first got the unit it was locked into auto mode. It took me a while to figure out how to unlock it so that I could use the other modes. I am single, thus my daily dish load is light.

Bosch Dishwasher,"I find the Bosch Dishwasher less than what we expected.   The diswasher is quiet and get the dishes clean .. this is what is expected primarily, however we find that it doesn't have the capacity as our prevous dishwasher.  We are running more loads.  To compensate, we have removed the utensil rack in the lower basket to add more space for larger pans and other dishes.   In addition, the door doesn't seem sturdy and robust as prevous dishwashers.  When closing it from its wide open position, it feels like its flexing.  We are also not a fan of the top controls .. the instructions were limited in how to reset it when settings are stuck on a certain setting. We had to do an internet search to find this out. It also does not make sense why the control lights are on when opening the dishwasher after completion. This does not make sense either .. the control lights should be off. We feel compelled to push the off button but this is not done everytime .. is this a problem, we simply don't know.    The red light on the floor is nice, but why didn't Bosch go ahead put a green one there to denote completion?  Seems like a logical thing to do.

Great cleaning from quiet machine.,"Love the quiet of this dishwasher. Grateful for the light on the floor that lets you know it's running. 
Not sure how I feel about the upper rack. It's not really deep enough for anything but some silverware and it cuts down in the height of the second rack. Some glasses don't fit.

Good quality; better clean,"While stainless wasn't my first choice, I have been pleased with the way this looks in my kitchen. The racks are roomy and adequate. I find the third rack for silverware to be useful. The unit is very quiet and you really don't even know it is running. I have not had any issues with the drying process, despite the unit not using heat to dry. Other than in recessed areas of dishes, they come out dry and ready to put away. I find the air dry feature to also be a benefit. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]",100,"April 8, 2020"

My Second Bosch Dishwasher,"Bought another Bosch DW when I bought another home.  Was happy with the first one and like this one even more.  Have been using it for over a month now.  Love the third rack on top for spatulas, tongs, unusual items that have no other place to go in a dishwasher.  This model is very quiet, as was my first model, but this one has a much better rack loading system so I can put my soup bowls and pot lids in the rack - finally the spacing between the tines is correct for my dishes.  Couple of draw backs:  DW had a strong odor (like a chemical/oily smell) for a few weeks.  Had to leave the door open after the cycle was over for many weeks.  Also, the ""Bosch"" logo handle on the middle shelf keeps coming off.  Love the red glowing light on the floor showing me the DW is still running.  Prefer white appliances that do not show fingerprints and smears, but this one is Stainless to match the other appliances in this house.    Too bad it shows the dark smears, fingerprints and water marks like most Stainless appliances.  I was a little uncomfortable buying a DW that had the top of door controls, but have quickly grown to like it.  Have used the Sanitize cycle many times.  Would highly recommend this Dishwasher.  Would give this DW a 5 Star Rating, but it would have to be nearly perfect for 5 stars. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]",80,"April 6, 2020"

First time with Bosch,"had to get a new DW, so read all the reviews I could find - all said that Bosch was the #1 brand to get.  Installed ourselves in a couple of hours - no real problems there.   Unit does a really good job with cleaning, and is very quiet as expected.
I love the cutlery drawer, but find that the extra tall glasses I have no longer fit so those have to be hand washed now.   
My one real complaint is with the bottom tray design.   I am still struggling with how to arrange pots and pans in this tray.  All the prongs are angled, which is great for plates, but the pots and frying pans do not fit worth a darn.  I end up doing some hand washing which is a step backward.  So, best I can say is a 3.5 out of 5.   Everything is great other than that lower tray. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]",80,"April 5, 2020"

Quietest Dishwasher,My wife and I purchased the Bosch 500 series dishwasher last month.  It has proven to be the best dishwasher we have ever owned in the 41 years that we have been married.  The Bosch 500 does an exceptional job cleaning dishes.  It is the quietest dishwasher we have ever owned.  We love the third pull out tray at the top.

Perfect helper during COVID-19 quarantine,"We've had this dishwasher with us for just a little bit over two months and it's been great! I'm writing this review in the middle of the quarantine due to COVID-19 and we're definitel glad we have it during this time; it can hold so many more dishes than our older one that we don't have to run it every day.
This is what we think on a couple of separate points:

1. Dish cleanliness
This Bosch dishwasher leaves dishes very clean. Previously we had to rinse and scrape most of our plates, but not anymore. This saves us a good amount of time (and water) in the evenings after dinner, as we can put the dishes without rinsing (we do still scrape chunks of food, though).

2. Drying
I'd rate it about 9.5/10 in terms of how dry the dishes come out. This model doesn't have the heating element, but it has an option where the door pops open after it's done. Most dishes are dry, except for the small plastic containers that flip during the washing cycle. With a little bit of rinse aid, most dishes dry without spots.
Here we had a small issue where the door doesn't pop open everytime. About a quarter or a third of the time, the door only opens a tiny bit and the vapor condenses under our counter. This might be an issue if you have, like we do, the laminate countertops. It was covered under warranty and they're going to come and fix this whenever quarantine is over. So far, that's the only issue we've found.

3. Carrying capacity
The racks have the spacings well designed and they can hold a lot of plates, which we love. Some portions of the racks are adjustable, in case you have deeper bowls. But my favorite feature is the third rack on top. This feature may have come out a long time ago, but this is the first time we've had a dishwasher with this option and we love it. You can fit extra silverware, small lids, cooking spoons and spatulas, sippy cup lids, and a bunch of the tiny things that are too small to stay contained anywhere else.

4. Looks
Looks good. Minimalistic design with the buttons on top that can't be seen when the door is closed. I'd prefer to see the buttons, but it's OK, not a big deal.

5. Durability/Reliability
So far we've only had this for a little bit over two months, so we can't talk much about durability. If something breaks within the first couple of years I may adjust the rating to reflect that, but right now it's working, so it is still 5 stars.

TL;DR: Dishwasher is awesome. Holds a lot of dishes. Dries with pretty much no spots. Door doesn't pop all the way open all the time, but covered under warranty. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]",100,"April 4, 2020"
A Great Machine!,"I had a Bosch dishwasher in my previous house and loved it.  I moved a couple years ago and when I had to replace my dishwasher I didn't even think about anything but a Bosch dishwasher.

Nice and Quiet,"For the most part I am pleased with the dishwasher. It has been a complete game changer, I can actually run the dishwasher while people are over or even just to watch tv. Only issue I have is that with the third rack (which is super convenient and useful) it makes the rest of the racks squished, not as deep. Also the start mechanism is weird, I don't like that you can open it while it is cleaning. I wish after it opens to dry that it would turn itself off.

Clean dishes,"The dishes come out fantastic. I would give it 5 stars, but when I first tried to start the dishwasher, it didn't start. I looked through the manual, tried the reset button, and finally, I had to call customer service.  Customer service walked me through the steps of resetting the dishwasher. It had enough steps that I had to write it down and review it. It apparently needs a ""reboot"" once in awhile. Customer servie was excellent. There was no waiting time, and it was indeed 24/7 as I think I called at about 10 pm in frustration. This instruction was no where in the manual and it should be. Press ""reset"" for 3 seconds.When the indicator shows .01, close door, wait 1 minute. Open door. Turn off. Then turn on... starting a dishwasher should NOT be so complicated! [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]",80,"April 3, 2020"
Huge upgrade,Dumped a Whirpool for this with amazing results; cleaner dishes by simple scrape and load. Third upper rack is an excellent option. Still experimenting with placement of larger items and long stem wine glasses but they sparkle when the cycle is over.,100,"April 3, 2020"
Only one minor flaw,"Washes and dries exceptionally well. I especially like the way it opens the door a little to improve drying, which works quite well. Also of course, it is unusually quiet. As others have mentioned elsewhere, the only drawback is closely spaced tines in the dish rack. If you only use thinner plates without much of a rim, you won't have any problem but if your dishes are thicker and have a lip around the edges, the spacing is generally too close to allow good water flow and cleaning, so loading will be less efficeint than it could be. I wish there was an alternate rack available. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]",80,"April 3, 2020"

Great Diswasher,"I spent quite a bit of time repairing my 8 year old LG dishwasher. When I gave up on it, I spent quite a bit of time researching the replacement before finally settling on either the BOSCH 500 or 800 Series, depending on which one I could get a better deal on. 

It ended up being the 500 and I've been very happy with it. The upgrades from the older LG are numerous - racks that move up and down, the ability to remove the silverware holder in favor of the third rack, the door opening at the end of a cycle to provide better drying, etc.. 

This would be a five star review were it not for BOSCH's own reputation. Given the reviews I read, the professionals I talked to, and the stars on this very page, I expected it to clean and dry better than any dishwasher I had ever come across. It does not. I haven't come across dishwashers that do better than this one but that old LG did an equally profecient job. Because it was a BOSCH, I was expecting to be blown away and instead I was just extremely satisfied. 

Is that worth a one star ding? I don't know, but it's my review and I can do what I want. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]",80,"April 2, 2020"
Great Product,"Purchased this to replace a different brand. The other brand we practically had to was the dishes prior to loading them. This one, simply scrape and load. Dishes come out sparkling clean. My only complaint is the dishes don't dry as good as with the other dishwasher. However, we figured out how to overcome that, we set it to air-dry. So when the unit is finished washing, the door pops open. By the time we are ready to unload, the dishes are dry. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]",100,"April 2, 2020"

Bosch Dishwasher Model SHPM65Z55N Review,"Extremely quiet. Cleans items well although with our hard water, it has trouble getting some of our glasses crystal clear clean, even with rinse additives. Our old Kenmore DW had similar trouble. Did I mention it is really quiet? We run it two to three times each week and the interior gets to smell a bit ripe after a day or two of non-use even though we rinse items off before placing them in the DW. To combat odor, we try and leave the DW door open a bit each night, which seems to help. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]",80,"April 2, 2020"

The Bosch 500 series was the Wirecutter's best option, and I loved that it had a separate rack for silverware, which left more room for pots and pans on the bottom rack. I'm thrilled with it! It does a fantastic job of cleaning dirty dishes that I would never have dreamed of putting into my old washer without at least a day's worth of soaking, and it's so quiet that I sometimes have to double-check to make sure I turned it on. Time will tell if the washer holds up as long as my last one, but so far I am beyond thrilled. I'll rave about this washer to all my friends!

"Ok, not great","Too small to get in everything you would expect to be able to fit into a dishwasher. Configuration is inconvenient. Difficult to troubleshoot, however, the 24x7 support is nice - if you get someone who's interested in helping and isn't annoyed that you bothered him/her with your questions. I've had this type, as well as helpful support people. Pretty expensive dishwasher for the issues I've run into. But it is quiet.

Whisper Quiet,"How many times since we purchased our new Bosch 500 Series Dishwasher have, I asked my wife, ""Are you sure the dishwasher is really running?""

Dishwashee,I only gave this a four star rating because the dishwasher doesn't do the best job when it comes to drying the dishes.  The dishwasher is very quiet and cleans the dishes very well.  I like the red light on the floor so I know when the dishwasher is on or when I have it set for a delayed start.  I'm disappointed that when I go to empty my dishwasher that many of the items are still wet if have water on them. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.],80,"March 28, 2020"

Crazy quiet,"I purchased this dishwasher back in January.  Price was right, and this thing is so quiet, if it were not for the red light that shines on the floor, to tell you it is running,  you would think it was off.  The auto air feature is fantastic, dished come out drier, and you don't get that funk smell, like you would with dishwashers, when you leave them shut overnight, after running it.  Glasses are crystal clear clean, silverware, no spotting.  I can't say enough how impressed with this dishwasher. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]",100,"March 27, 2020"

Quiet & Powerful,We replaced a 4yr old Frigidaire Gallery that did a poor job of drying plastics/pots/pans and didn't get all of the food off of plates. We haven't needed to finish drying more than 5 items (if that). We typically run the dishwasher at night which is just outside our bedroom (on the otherside of our bedroom wall) and it is very quiet. Even doing work in the kitchen it is at times hard to hear if it is even running. I am very happy we upgraded from our other unit to this.

Such an improvement!,"After 16 years, it’s wonderful to have a new dishwasher!
What’s great:  quiet, gets dishes 100% cleaner, love third rack, 
What’s not so great: loading large round soup/cereal bowls is awkward, soap pellet doesn’t fit well in dispenser, when door is slightly ajar the display blinks annoyingly and beeps when you push it shut. Unnecessary noise and blinks are irritating. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]",80,"March 27, 2020"
Simply the Best!,"I love my Bosch dishwasher!  It gets my dishes so clean and I love the top silverware drawer.  At first I didn't think I would use it much, but it makes putting up your silverware so easy!  Organize it when you put it in and then just pick up a section and it's ready to put in the drawer!  Love it!  I really like the light that shines on the floor when it is running.  It's so quiet, so that's the way I know it's running!  A solid 10 overall!

Really Cleans,Replaced our second Kitchen Aid in 5 years with the Bosch. Cleaned better the first wash than any other dishwasher I have ever used. No need to prerinse just scrape off the big items. Also the fact that the door pops open after the cycle to allow the dishes to get a spotless dry is worth every penny. We used it without the finish rinse aide and the dishes looked awesome but then tried it with it and I have never seen dishes come out so sparkly!! This dishwasher is everything you could ever want in a dishwasher. Feels extremely durable and cleans like a champ. Would recommend to anyone and if I had to make a choice would buy this one over and over. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.],100,"March 26, 2020"
My bosch,"This is my 2nd Bosch dishwasher I have bought in the past 3 years, 1 for my fiance at the time and now we've moved into another ho.e and replaced the one that was here.

"Bosch 500 Series Dishwasher (Bothell, Washington)","We replaced our GE Profile dishwasher with a Bosch unit. Absolutely no comparison between the two. The Bosch is as close to silent as one could expect. The red indicator light is the only means to determine if the unit is in operation. 
Our dishes feel different coming from the Bosch as apposed to the GE. They feel cleaner, dryer, and come out spot free. Wish we had made the change sooner.

Great dishwashed but programming could be better.,"It took me a while to get used to the dishwasher as compared to my old one which did an awesome job cleaning my dishes.  This one cleans fairly well but I have one complaint regarding the ""automatic door opening"".  The dishwasher should open the door immediately after the final rinse to allow the dishes to dry and evaporate the water while they are still hot.  In this dishwasher, it waits until the dry cycle is done before opening the door.  It wastes the heat the could dry the dishes much faster.

New to Bosch,I was encouraged to try this dishwasher based on a few of my friends opinions of the brand. They were all extremely satisfied so I decided to give it a try. The only thing I realized that was different compared to other dishwashers is at the time it takes to wash his dishes appears to be a bit longer. But that goes with all the newer models of dishwashers however they are energy-efficient. I do have to say that this dishwasher is so quiet. I forget it is on. I do enjoy having my dishes dried so I like using the air dry option. The dishes of been coming out beautifully clean without any spots whatsoever and I do have hard water. That was a problem with my previous dishwasher or spots being missed in with this one every dish comes out crystal clear. I am extremely satisfied and would highly recommend this to anybody else [This review was collected as part of a promotion.],100,"March 25, 2020"

Love this dishwasher,"This dishwasher is so quiet, we can hardly hear it running.  It cleans the dishes very well.  No spots on glasses or dishes, and most of the items are completely dry.

I love my new dishwasher!,"Bosch dishwasher is quite, efficient does a great job washing the dishes.  It is very efficient!  It has a sleek, clean look as well!  I only gave it 4 stars because the Users Manual should be clearer and user friendly as the controls are digital and should have digital friendly tips.
The installation was okay.  I wasn't happy about that.  It sticks out a tad from the counter and out of two delivery guys bringing it to my apartment only one worked on the installation.  I feel that two techs usually work together and better to provide optimal services.",80,"March 23, 2020"

Went beyond expectations,"I went with the Bosch over other brands because of the build quality.

We like it; no problems with the dw so far.,"We have owned this dishwasher for 1 or 2 months. We like that it has no handle to poke us while we're preparing meals in front of it. We like that there is no exposed heating element in the bottom to burn the food the kids forget to rinse off and create smells inside the dishwasher (like our previous dishwasher did). We like that the filters are located front/center and are easy to remove & clean. We like that the prongs are flexible - they can be moved up or down to accommodate bowls in different locations. I like the automatic door open feature for extra drying. Cons: the same auto-door feature makes the appliance a bit harder to close - need to give a little extra pressure when closing it or it just pops open again. I turned the silverware compartment around, with the tall side inward, to make it easier to add silverware without pulling the whole bottom drawer out. We aren't used to the 3rd drawer up top and find ourselves searching for missing utensils sometimes, but we will adapt over time. We have had no problems with the new dishwasher.

Dishwasher,"Love it!  The feature I like the best is the door opens when cycle is complete,  The top rack is great for silverware,  I feel the silverware comes out better than using the basket.

"Cleans very well, but space is a bit tight",The machine itself works very well.  Dishes always come out clean.  The majority of dishes come out dry as well.  Our only complaint is the top rack is not tall enough with the utensil rack in to handle tall plastic cups or bottles.  We've had to resort to either hand washing or risking them on the bottom rack.

Learning Best Practices for This Appliance,"This is our first Bosch dishwasher and I am still learning the most effective and efficient ways to load the racks.

Silent Dishwasher,"This is my second Bosch within 10 ten years, and this model is much more quieter than the first one that I had. I love how spacious Bosch dishwashers are compared to other brands as I can adjust the different racks to add bigger loads. The only issue I had with this model is that it clogged after several weeks of usage. I scrapped the plates before loading, but food still caused the clog. However, the dishwasher began to function properly when the drain was cleared. Overall, I believe that this is a quiet, well made, efficient dishwasher.

Very pleased with my new Bosch dishwasher,The thing I like most about this appliance is the automatic door opening when the cycle is complete.  It really helps to dry the dishes - especially the plastic bowls on the top shelf.  I also love the newly designed silverware tray above the top rack..  I took the normal silverware basket out and have more room on the lower shelf.  When silverware is placed in the tray with like pieces together - it is so easy to put the silverware away --- small spoons together -- large spoons together -- likewise forks and knives in a separate place.

New 500 Series Bosch,"Overall, we like our new Bosch dishwasher. However, the stainless steel finish does not match our LG refrigerator, GE stove and Whirlpool microwave as well as we would like. The drying of the dishes is better with the cycle that opens the dishwasher door but we still have water at the base of coffee mugs.  The hookup to the house water was difficult.  Would appreciate a brass hose bib rather than plastic. Initial installation resulted in leakage. The plastic bib wanted to cross thread.  I would have purchased the 800 series but we wanted a recessed door handle.  Still, in terms of cleaning Bosch is the best per consumer testing.

Never thought a dishwasher was “life changing”...,I realize the title sounds a bit dramatic...but I'd always just considered dishwashers all the same. They aren't! I've had high-end dishwashers from other brands but this is my first Bosch. It is better. Fantastic design...brilliant cleaning. It saves time having to prewash / rewash and has become a real timesaver in the kitchen. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.],100,"March 17, 2020"
A new washer leads to learning new better methods,"Just like getting a new car, a new dishwasher has new capabilities and features that I have learned to use and appreciate. It is really quite so I like the red light that is projected on the floor, it lets me know that it is still running or if it is flashing, I know that it needs attention. The stainless steel front panel looks good in my kitchen but I need to find out how to minimize the finger prints. The filter system in the bottom of the washer is easy to access, I just need to remember to look down there when I open the door. The design of the dish racks shows that a lot of attention was given to their usage. With my old dishwasher, I was not careful the placement of the dishes would block the water flow to and around the detergent dispensor in the door. This would result in the detergent getting wet enough to clog up but not disolve and to its job. With this dishwasher that problem has been eliminated. Another new learning experience was loading the dishes into the racks, it has three racks instead of the normal two. Nesseled into the very top is a shallow rack intended to hold the knives, forks and spoons. By paying attention as how they are arranged while loading, then aftwards putting them away is much more efficient. Sometimes, I am able to get all of the flatware in this top rack which allows me to remove the basket in the bottom rack where I used to put them. This extra space lets me get more stuff down there. All three racks have flexibility built in. The middle rack can be adjusted up and down. In addidion all three racks have even more adjustability in that some of the fingers that divide and support the items being washed are adjustable. This lets me taylor these racks to fit my dishes, pots, pans and glasses to fit my needs. And, if I remember to put in the detergent, the dishwasher does get all that stuff clean. Another capability is that I can have it open the door a bit when it is finished. This does two things, it allows the air to circulate helping to finish drying the contents and I can see at a distance that it has finished the load.

Great appliance,We are impressed by the quiet operation and the design of the interior.  It holds more dishes than we have.  We run it when we are out of silverware.  It also looks great and is easy to clean the stainless exterior.  All positive with Bosch products. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.],100,"March 16, 2020"
Great dishwasher,"I LOVE my new Bosch diswasher! I'm still learning to load it. The light on the floor is a great idea, as it is very quiet when running. I wish the silverware basket had bigger slots, though. Not a deal breaker. I wished I had bought the Bosch 2 years earlier with the kitchen remodel. Our Kitchenaid only lasted 2 years.

I wanted a Bosch,"My family and I just moved into a home with aging appliances. The existing dishwasher was held together with duct tape. (No kidding.) Our previous home, which all of us sorely missed, had a Bosch dishwasher than was quiet, efficient, and had this wonderful third rack! I decided to buy us a new dishwasher for Christmas and we returned to our beloved Bosch. We bought the model ""up"" from our former Bosch and I love it. Quiet, easy to use, flexible loading, and does a great job with the dishes. It's a taste of our old home in our new one.",100,"March 15, 2020"

More tech assistance for the technology challenged,"The biggest complaint I have is that the guides included with my dishwasher were totally inadequate to answer many of my questions regarding the simple use of the machine.  Finally, I resorted to on-line manual which was able to explain things, especially the appearance of the green light on the floor, as well as, how to set the various programming functions.  There was not a single reference to the green light, itself.  I am sorry, but there was woefully inadequate guidance with the manuals.  Telephone assistance was great to explain why the dishwasher was not able to be started initially with a blinking green light. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]",80,"March 12, 2020"
The horrors of co-workers convinced me to buy it.,"This dishwasher is handling food and pumping out dry dishes. Very impressed. Switched to Bosch because at my office we have 4 Bosch's. Each of which run multiple loads a day. And these aren't normal loads of dirty dishes. They are filled with the most disgusting of communcal dishwasher etiqueite. Entire plates covered in peanut butter, bowls with microwave baked on soup residue. Cups with that nasty coffee gunk in the bottom becaue they sat at a desk for two weeks. You wouldn't believe what people put in them. Not to mention absolutely zero attention to proper loading instructions. Things are just everywhere. I figured if it can handle that co-worker chaos, then it will certinaly take care of a normal family volume with even a nod to loading it in a way that any decent human would. Highly recommend.

Very nice dishwasher,"With our previous dishwasher, we always had to pre-wash or they came out dirty.  With our new Bosch dishwasher, pre-washing is no longer needed.  We didn't neleive it at first, but after a couple of loads, we just scrape.  We have reduced our water usage for dishes, which is important where we live (California).   Excellent design allows easy and efficent loading.  Very quiet.... can hardly tell its running.  I highly recommend this dishwasher.

Good dish washer,"Good dish washer.  It performs as advertised. My wife and I are satisfied. 
On a side bar, the installation was a little rocky: this dish washer comes with a plug, and our old machine was hard-wired in, so the install tech said 
we
 had to go to the hard ware store, get a recepticle, and have an electrician in stall before, the machine could be hooked-up. Be ware when negotiating installation with the retailer. Good luck. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]",100,"March 12, 2020"

Clean dishes at last!,"For two years we complained about our builder-installed GE Dishwasher because the one thing it NEVER did was get the dishes clean.  We always clean & rinse whatever goes in the dishwasher because it may be several days before we run it, so there was really no excuse for them not to be clean.  Sometimes I thought the dishes were actually dirtier/smearier after it was run!  After researching dishwashers we decided on the Bosch because CLEANING the dishes was the area in which it excelled, according to the test kitchens.  They were not wrong!  We love this dishwasher!  Everything is squeaky clean.  We also like the racks...especially the top rack for silverware.  Even our wine glasses come out crystal clear.  Thank you!!

Great Dishwasher,"Bought this Bosch Dishwasher and have been using it for over a month now.  It does a great job cleaning and is very quiet.  It is so quiet that I opened it mid cycle once because I didnt' realize it was riunning! There is a red light that eluminates the floor, so I now have trained myself to look for that before opening it.  We read about complaints of smell coming from it.  We have not noticed that problem.  We clean the filter a couple times a month - it's very easy.  We have not observed any problems with dishes not drying completely.  It's all good.

Brought it home an hooked up in less than an hour. She was delighted. We sat right next to the dishwasher and had a normal conversation. Unbelievably quiet! For the next two weeks she showed her Bosch off to everyone who came over and all were impressed with the quiet operations. Cleans very well and she loves the adjustable rack.

2nd Bosch Dishwasher,"This is our second one, I do like some of the qualities on this one - 1) red light on the floor so you know the dishwasher is on or off. 2) 3rd upper rack 3) Very quite.   The ""automatic"" door open after the wash is done has yet to work.  Stacking the dishes is a challenge from the way the bottom rack is lined up.  Do I put bowl/short plates this way or this way?  So I can put bigger dinner plates in?  And, only 2 of us here, so we only run it every 2nd or 3rd day so the smell of dirty dishes (and we rinse ours) leaves a stuffing smell until you do a load.

Very Quiet and great cleaning.,I really like the Bosch 500 Series dishwasher.   It runs extremely quietly and cleans great.   I gave it 4 stars because it doesn't include a heated drying cycle.

Generally great,"Works well & is very quiet. Sometimes small amounts of our biodegradable powdered detergent is left on items in the top drawer. We feel strongly that using products that are healthy for us and the earth, instead of toxic chlorine, etc,. is important. So we just rinse off the small deposits. We also use biodegradable rinse agent, again w/o toxic ingredients. The dishwasher could do better on items like glass and metal pans with encrusted food. But generally it cleans very well.

So disappointed,"I could cry......  I did research on dishwashers before I decided on this one.  Even talked to very nice person at Bosch who talked to me about the drying situation.  I thought this “open door” thing would be okay.  It is not!  I have had the dw for less than two weeks.......and I hate not having dry dishes!  I want to put glasses and cups and pots straight from dw to shelf and that cannot happen.    After even two days of the open door, cups still have water on the bottom and pots have water inside.  Can’t put wet cups on shelf, etc.  I now have a drying rack on counter to place dishes to dry....  The door pops open so far that it protrudes into my galley kitchen.  Can’t shut it because of the moisture inside; dishes would NEVER dry.  It does clean well and noise level is okay, but I do not want to live with this for several years.....",40,"March 5, 2020"
I'm in love!,"After many years of washing dishes by hand, my husband picked out what he said was the best dishwasher and said let's enter the 21st century. So I agreed. I left it in his hands and trusted what he said was going to be the best. I will say that I read the operation manual, and I have done everything ""right"" with cleaning once per month and using rinse aid. 
I have only ever used the Auto cycle with the Auto air dry option, and I have only had one negative experience (more on that in a moment).
When I first got the dishwasher, I wanted to ""help"" it by making sure my dishes were completely rinsed of debris before I loaded them; they came out clean.
As the weeks have gone by, I have loaded without rinsing, minus any large pieces of debris on the plates and the dishes continue to come out SO CLEAN.
I typically run the washer overnight, it pops open to air dry, and by the time I am home from work the next day, the dishes are completely dry to be put away, minus any awkward angles that I didnt realize...aka the indented bottom of my coffee mugs may still have water sitting on top; as long as you unload from the bottom drawer up, you won't risk spilling any water on dry dishes.
Moving on: the only slightly disappointing thing I have to say about this dishwasher is that no matter where I place my re-usable tupperwares, the wash is SO POWERFUL that they are blown around and usually full of water by the end of the cycle...I have even jammed them into spots where I thought there was no way they could move...they did. Furthermore, even using the recommended pods and jet dry liquid, the typical white residue was left on the tupperware here and there. SOLUTION: I hand-wash my tupperware. It's a small price to pay for the great job on the rest of the dishes, and there's no reason to take a star away for that. 
I've never used the moveable rack feature...I've never had anything to wash so tall that I needed to do that. 
Love the top rack for washing measuring cups and utelsils, because few of mine will actually fit in the silverware holder...but they always do in the top rack.
Lastly, the only negative experience aforementioned, was because I shut the dishwasher after it had popped open (before I left for work one morning) and didn't allow the dishes to dry properly. When I re-opened, they were covered in a light mist from all the moisture that had collected while the door was shut, and everything just seemed eww, so I ran the washer again. Moral of the story: let it do its thing! Don't complain about having wet dishes because you didn't give them long enough to air dry! Or, use a towl to finish drying them. It's not an inconvenience if you TRULY want sparkling clean dishes every single time! I'm very happy with this purchase! If you absolutely MUST have dry dishes and the long air dry is an inconveinence, buy something else! [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]",100,"March 5, 2020"

Bosch Is a QUIET machine,"The Bosch 500 is a very nice machine, well designed to use space and is very quiet. I found that it took a little effort to figure out how to best use the machine settings for excellent results, but after 4-5 experiments I found the best way to achieve clean dry dishes with the evaporative drying method. That proved to be fine once I routinely set the door to open at the end of the cleaning cycle. Otherwise, dishes were regularly damp.

love this dishwasher,"I've owned alot of dishwashers in the last 30 years, and this is by far the best one I've ever had. First, it is so quiet I hardly know it is running. I love that it has a feature that will pop the door open if I want it to air dry after the wash cycle is finished. I love that it has a top rack for big spoons and other types of big flatware or lids. The middle shelf is also adjustable up and down which is a nice feature if you need to wash a tall item like long stemmed wine glasses. But the most important thing of course is that the dishes come out sparkling clean. I've had it for over a month, and I run it at least once a day, and I have yet to see any dish that needs to be rewashed or hand washed because it didn't get clean. I would recommend this to anyone. So happy with it. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]",100,"March 4, 2020"
Replacement for 12YO Miele - goes VERY Well!,"I am really happy with this appliance! Like my title indicates, this was a replacement for an older Miele (which had served us well) but all of the great reviews on this product (and the cost compared to Miele) sent me in the direction of this unit. The Bosch exceeded all of my expectations; It cleaned and dried very well, the height adjustment for the upper shelf was an ingenious solution to a “tall glass” issue, and the silverware drawer (at the top of the unit) is a new spin on the concept for us as it works very well, is really convenient for load/unload, and we put the bottom shelf silverware baskets in a closet and now enjoy the increased real estate in the bottom shelf. The unit is dead quiet during operation and the projected (red) light on the floor is great for active cycle indication.

My only criticism (which I got used to quickly) was setting the elevation of the unit (as to not leave too large of a gap between the top of the unit and the bottom of the counter) meant that you need to open the door to set the cycle parameters and press the “start cycle” button then you need to close the door to start the cycle – not a huge problem but different than expectations. Also, if you push too many buttons when starting a cycle you can’t make any changes until you hold the “start’” button down for 5 seconds. This wasn’t documented anywhere so it took a little while to figure out. Finally there’s a few programming options (like jet dry strength, enabling/disabling Auto-air door opening) that you need to use the programing instructions, it’s not hard, but the manual is not great and it takes a little practice.]

Love It,"We replaced an expensive, 5 year old diswasher from another manufacturer with this one. They looked very similar on the outside, but the difference in performance is astonishing. 

We were seriously considering getting new dishes because food was always glued to our plates after the cycle completed on the old dishwasher. We really thought it was our dishes. 

When the old dishwasher's pump went out, we decided not to fix it and just get a new dishwasher. So happy we did. This thing leaves our dishes spotless and our glassware is sparkling. We use generic liquid detergent and no rinse aid. When I think of all the time we spent hand-scrubbing dishes with our old dishwasher, it makes me so mad. Thanks BOSCH!

Great dishwasher!!!,This is simply a great dishwasher and the best I have ever owned. The dishes come out clean even when stacked closely together and the machine is very quiet. The biggest problem we have with this machine is that the racks are so perfectly setup that we run out of plates and bowls before the unit is full!! This is a very good problem to have!!! The outside of our unit is black and it stays very clean and does not show fingerprints. I also like how all of the controls are hidden on the top of the door. If you need a new dishwasher this is the one to own. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.],100,"March 2, 2020"
Love this dishwasher!!,I can't say enough about how much I love this dishwasher! It replaced another top brand that was only 7 years old. No comparison! This machine cleans so much better than my other did brand new. I love the quietness of it and am thankful for the red light that shines on the floor to let me know it is still running. I wouldnt know otherwise without getting up and checking. That is how quiet it is. Highly recommend this dishwasher!!! [This review was collected as part of a promotion.],100,"March 2, 2020"

"Great machine, few nitpicks.","Bought a new dishwasher because our old one crapped it. It definitely cleans the dishes very well and I haven't noticed any spots left over on my dishes. The dishwasher is also really quiet so that's a bonus.

 My main complaints are the top rack is a little high up so taller glasses won't fitand I wish the dishes would be a bit dryer at the end of the cycle. The final complaint is this dish washer wants you to add rinse aid which is no problem however it seems to use a large amount of it because when purchased, it came with a 23 load supply and I added more and with in about 10 loads the red light is on saying it needs more.

Other than that this dishwasher is doing great and I will update if something happens in under a year or so. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]",80,"March 1, 2020"

Great Washer Inside & Out,Outside:  it's very sleek and the controls and handles are out of the way.  That's great for my narrow galley kitchen.  The washer is also whisper quiet... so much so that there is a useful light that shines at the buttom towards the floor to let us know it's working/done.  Inside:  It's spacious and is configured to let us place bulky pots and pans alongside dishes without a frustrating game of Dishwasher Tetris.  We enjoy the auto open feature that lets the dishes vent dry to the room after they're done.  The only improvement I would add is to change the red dot that shines on the floor to a projection of how much time is left in the cycle.

Bosch 500 series dishwasher,MOstly we like our dishwasher.  There was a ton of confusion as to whether or not we needed to purchase Bosch's expensive power cord--the machine we got came with it.  but not the water connect.  after a month we are still figuring out how best to load it.  We really like the top tray and adjustable shelves (usually they are in the same position but we CAN move them sometimes the silverware on the top rack doesn't come clean.

Just about perfect,"Installed myself, and installation was relatively straightforward.  Cleans surprisingly well, even with bowls and dishes closely spaced apart.  My only complaint is that the ""clean light"" will only be lit for a few seconds after a load, and then defaults back to a flashing ""auto"" load setting - I wish the indicator stayed lit so others could see a load is clean.  And of course it's silent. No need for a quieter dishwasher unless you're OCD or dysfunctionally vain. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]",80,"February 29, 2020"

MY NEW BFF - MY NEW BOSCH DISHWASHER,"In the many years living in my home, I have had 6 automatic dishwashers - all leading name brands with top of the line features.  This new Bosch is my favorite. Why? It's a good looking appliance, quiet and most efficient, just like the previous models I've always purchased.  At first glance I thought ""what is this new internal design about?""  Well it's ingenious! This is the most practical design for strategically loading and unloading dishes, pots, flatware and utensils.  Unlike my last model which took at least 2 hours to get the daily task done, everything comes out spotless - in one hour. Amazing!  Simplicity and efficiency - just perfection for getting the job done.  I love it; it's not just a pretty face!  Thank you from fussy homemakers who appreciate all the help they can get.

"For the money, not worth it. We purchased a Samsung dishwasher from Home Depo 3 years ago with a ...","For the money, not worth it. We purchased a Samsung dishwasher from Home Depo 3 years ago with a stove and a fridge together only to end up highly disappointed in the products. We spend a mint on them. Not cheap! The dishwasher was around $420 and ended up being the worst, lasting only about 3 years and becoming a fire hazard. I made the mistake of letting it get past warranty so we cut our losses, got rid of the fire hazard Samsung garbage dish washer and returned to Home Depo to shop for something better. We went for broke this time and purchased the Bosch. We where told was the BEST of the best and would be happy with the results. Well, .... I may never buy another appliance from Home Depo again. Where do I begin. 
1.) The door opens very stiff. Not easy to open and close
2.) The bottom rack is defective. The wheels on the bottom rack do NOT alien right with the lip on the inside of the tub. So the rack doesn't slide in and out easily the way it should, it falls to the right and the left and crooked inside the tub. I have to pick up the whole rack and place it on the door to get it out every single time I use it. The rack doesn't slide in the right way unless I pick it up and place it in on the track otherwise it falls off on top of the rotating spray jet, preventing the washer water from reaching the dishes and doing its job well. The bottom rack design, wheels and interior tub is a total fail!!! For a grand, I would have expected a much more user friendly dishwasher. After all, for the amount of time I spent fighting with the bottom rack, I probably could have just saved my back and washed everything myself in the sink.

Home Depot charged us $150 for installation, then when their subcontractor came to install the dishwasher, they charged us an additional $310. $460 for installation seems excessive to me, since we already had a KitchenAid dishwasher that was being replaced, and was operational. 

Like most other reviewers have reported, it operates very quietly, and projects a red light onto the floor while working. I've been using the automatic setting for washing the dishes, always use the recommended drying/spotting solution in addition to cleaning tablets. Does a good job cleaning dishes, cups, glasses, flatware. Doesn't do as good a job drying as my previous KitchenAid which I had for almost 20 years. Lowest rack dishes, dry fine. Flatware, I end up having to dry by hand, mugs and cups, divots in bottoms don't dry out even if left to dry all day or over night. I guess this is the best we can expect with the ""energy efficient models."" 

The design of the upper rack that holds cups glasses includes one very thin row that doesn't really hold my glasses or cups, so is more of a wasted area and to use it for small glasses they have to hang over the spindles, rather than between as is recommended. I use the uppermost rack for cooking utensils and small souffle cups, but it usually only contains a few things. My biggest concern is the latch, which seems a bit feeble. We leave dishes in the sink more often now, so that we don't have to constantly open/close the dishwasher

Again, my biggest issue is the excessive cost of installation.",80,"February 23, 2020"

And what a terrific upgrade it has been.  We love the space utilization 3 drawers affords us.  Each of the drawers can be adjusted to a certain degree most notably, the middle drawer which can be raised or lowered to account for height differences of the items you're washing.  This unit is extremely quiet and we love that it provides a time estimate for how long the cycle will take, even providing a 1 hour speed wash if you're in a hurry.  

But our favorite feature has to be the auto-open feature.  We run our dishwasher almost every night right after cleaning up the kitchen.  With the auto-open the dishes are completely dry save for a coffee mug or two which may have a recessed base which collected some water.  This feature is so clever and helpful.

So Quiet and Spacious!,"This dishwasher is by far the quietest dishwasher I have ever owned. It works very well and dishes come out squeaky clean, there's also SO much room in the washer.

Solid Diswasher,"This is the third Bosch dishwasher we've owned. We've always particularly appreciated how every one has both been quiet, and cleans the dishes even when stuffed to the gills with a large load (a daily occurrence with our family of 5). On this model, we appreciate the flexibility of the third silverware rack (we're able to fit even more in), and the way it pops open to air dry at the end, since we usually run it overnight. Opportunities for improvement: we didn't realize that by getting a model with a third rack, we'd lose the ability to fit 1/2 sheet pans in the bottom rack- there's just not enough vertical space. That's meant a lot more hand washing for us. We also miss having two separate silverware baskets, so if we need it, we don't have to take up the whole side of the bottom rack.",80,"February 13, 2020"

We use Cascade with Oxiclean and the label says it gives a brilliant finish, which is not true.  I won't recommend your product to anyone that asks me about it.",20,"February 13, 2020"
Bosch 500 Series Dishwasher,"I am not as happy with my dishwasher as I had hoped.  It functions just fine, but I have such a hard time loading it.  I know that the reason the bottom basket is lower is to allow for more dishes and for the upper rack, but that in combination with the extreme slant of the tines makes it much harder to load bowls and plates.  I wish I had spent a little more time looking at the racks and determining what would be a good fit for what I had been used to with my Whirlpool that lasted 23 years.

Simply the best,I have had a Bosch dishwasher for the last 8 years. The old one still looks and works like a new one but I wanted to put it in a rental house. I purchased a new Bosch for my own house and this one is really really nice. It's so quiet and has a lot of newer features compared to my old one. These products work great and last forever.

Nice Addition to Kitchen,It is a nice addition to the kitchen. It is quiet through most of the cycle. Now I can watch tv without the volume being on 30.

Water clings to plastic items really long after the door has popped open to air dry which then makes everything wet when unloading.

Bosch 500 dishwasher series,They keep on getting better. This is the second Bosch dishwasher I have owned. Easy installation for a DIY person.

Bosch 500 Series Washer,"Very quiet with a nice interior layout for dishes and silverware. The drain line was a bit short so I had to splice in the drain line from our old dishwasher to connect to our disposal drain port. One fairly big disappointment; the from leveling ""feet."" The front leveling was not easy, the ""feet"" and all of the leveling screws are plastic. To adjust the leveling screws you have to turn them by inserting a screwdiver into the petal-like feet. This is very difficult and the feet get damaged until you can get an 18mm wrench on the nut-like feature just above the feet. I found this difficult and not what your would expect from a higher-end dishwasher.",60,"February 10, 2020"

Super Quiet Working Machine,"This is the second appliance I have purchased from Bosch, it will not be my last.

The 500 Series Bosch dishwasher I own is the best; not only for the quiet (barely can hear the inner workings) but for the way my dishes come out ""squeaky"" clean.  The upper tray on this model is a bonus for flatware or cooking utensil, with an adjustable second self for larger items and the third shelf large and deep enough to hold most dishes or pots and pans, sometimes both.

I am very satisfied with my new Bosch 500 series dishwasher. Would I the recommend the series to a friend, you better believe I would and will; not only to friends but strangers as well. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]",100,"February 8, 2020"
Quality and Quiet,"This dishwasher is great! It is really quite and I love having the 3rd rack. I use it often. It takes time to get used to how to load it for maximum usage. The one drawback I found was it doesn't come with a manual, so if you want to know how to operate all it's functions, you need to go online. I would have preferred a book. I work on a computer 8-10 hours a day and don't really feel like getting on one when I get home. When we have called customer service, they have always been very helpful.

LOVE THIS DISHWASHER,"While this is a quite recent purchase, so I can't make a long-term review, this is the third dishwasher I have owned and is by far the best. It is the quietest and easiest to load for sure! I hope to have it for many years to come. We were willing to pay a little more than some brands to get an American made product. Having had 2 appliances that needed warranty work with another brand, and having to wait weeks and even MONTHS to get the parts and service work done, we narrowed our search down to Bosch and I believe we will not regret that decision, [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]",100,"February 6, 2020"
Bosh 500 Dishwasher,"Awesome product and so quiet (44 db) that there is a red light that refects on the floor to let you know this dishwasher is running. The shelf options are awesome, plus and extra third shelf on top. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]",100,"February 6, 2020"
Smells awful (did good job),"I am saddened to say that though the dishwasher did a wonderful job cleaning the dishes, the resulting awful smell in it upon completion was nauseating.  Unfortunately when I told the seller about the issue, she encouraged me to get another brand as a replacement. Now, I have a DIFFERENT brand, which I less prefer regarding loading and capacity that ALSO has an AWFUL smell upon cycle completion. I have had dishwashers for almost 50 years, and this is the first time I have had this issue.  The bad odor problem is confirmed by my husband. From what we now read, it seems that new water, and power conservation efforts have caused this unfortunate situation. I have only used the replacement d/w once.  The Bosch I had used approximately 4 times (had to wait for the replacement machine to be ordered,and arrive). Both d/w were installed by the plumber via the Big Box store from which purchased. Now we have to figure out how to avoid the BAD ODOR issue in a machine that I less prefer, but do intend to talk to management at the Big Box store.  I am now trying the Hi-Temp option to see if that will help (no plastics) . Also will contact mfg of new machine for advice.
Both models were at the upper price range of those offered at the store.
I recommend that NO NEW DISHWASHERS be purchased without taking this unfortnate issue into consideration. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]",40,"February 6, 2020"

Lovely!,"I love this dishwasher.  It's huge on the inside, cleans well, and is nice to operate.  My biggest complaints are that the items on the third shelf don't get very clean.  That is more for stuff that isn't very dirty.  The other ""complaint"" really isn't, but it's SO quite that more than a few times someone in my house opens the door and gets water all over.

Almost Perfect,"I really wanted to out 4.5, but here's how I'd rank it in individual categories.

For cleaning dishes, five stars. It does an amazing job. Even for baked on food, I was truly shocked by how spotless it cleaned a casserole dish that had some serious baked on residue.

For fit and finish, five stars. Love the detailed thought that went into designing it. The third rack is great for putting utensils and other small items on,  which opens up space in the other two racks. Several adjustable features also make for quick and easy options for loading and securing dishes. 

For ease of installation and noise, five stars. I installed it myself and the instructions were easy to follow. It's very quite too. You really don't hear it running. The red light that is visible on the floor when running is a nice feature to let you know that it is.

For drying, four stars. This model has the auto air feature which I liked since it automatically opens the dishwasher after completing its cycle to allow for further drying of the dishes. Despite this feature, and even after 8 - 9 hours later, there are still some dishes that are not completely dry. Especially, tupperware. Most everything else is dry. 

Overall, super happy with our purchase of this Bosch dishwasher. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]",80,"February 4, 2020"
My Bosch dishwasher,I didn't know dishwashers could clean dishes without basically cleaning them first. I would recommend the Bosch dishwasher to anyone.

Best dishwasher ever!,We could not be happier with this dishwasher purchase. After ever cycle all the dishes come out sparkling clean and the Auto Air feature is great at making sure the dishes are fully dry. The third-rack is also a life-saver since we can get in extra dishes. This was also a major upgrade over our last dishwasher since we could not be downstairs when we ran it and now we can't even hear it when it is running.

"Pretty nice, quiet, need to push too many buttons","So far, so good. Overall we're very happy with our new dishwasher, especially how quiet it is, which was one of our major issues with our last one. However, the design of the control software requires more button pushes than it should. For example, when the machine is all done with it's cycle, and notifies you, if you open the door and then close it again, it will alarm. You need to push the OFF button, even though it was already off. It's annoying and makes one wonder if anyone ever tried it. The same thing goes for when you want to start a new wash cycle. You have to hit the ON button, then select your desired wash cycle button, and then hit the start button. That's one button too many! (And as an engineer, I have to say that the buttons have a very unsatisfying feel - not a nice crisp click. You can feel the PC board behind the panel flex a bit when you hit a button.)",80,"February 3, 2020"

Innovative,"First off stainless steel interior is the only way to go. This unit has many Useful designs. The tableware tray up top is nothing short of genius. It's deceiving in that it holds larger utensils like ladles and such.
The upper shelf is adjustable in heighth to allow for larger pots in the lower tray without affecting the wash function. Both shelves have adjustable prongs that fold down flat when not needed. The upper shelf has a fold down dohickie that holds stem ware in place. All the trays slide in-and-out easily.
There is a easy to reach filter unit in the bottom that strains out debris.
The controls are on the top of the door and when the wash cycle has been selected and the door closed, are tucked away. This unit is so quiet that they smartly installed a red light that projects a small beam onto the floor under the door to show it's running. 
At the end of the wash/dry cycle the door pops open about six inches to allow the condensation to escape. No water spots on pans and plastic. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]",100,"February 2, 2020"

Is it running?,"After reading the reviews of several dishwashers I decided to step up to a Bosch since this was going to my first, and hopefully, my last dishwasher. The install was pretty straighforward for me but the surprise came when I put it through a test run. Being a little hard of hearing I couldn't hear it run at all. I installed it under the island I built in my kitchen and the back was still open so I could check for leaks. If it hadn't have been open I wouldn't have been able to feel the slight warmth coming off of the back of the unit. The little red light on the front of the unit that shines on the floor is supposed to let you know it's running but when you can't hear or feel anything you have to wonder.
The top 3rd tray is a bonus. I've removed the utensile holder and just use it for all the flatware. The second adjustable tray allows me to put larger items or even more plates on it. The adjustable tines in the trays allows you to adjust the spacing to suit your own needs as well. The auto air dry feature is also a plus since the unit opens automatically when the wash cycle is done. Even when set to half load my dishes come out clean as can be.

I love my new Bosch. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]",100,"January 30, 2020"
It's pretty good with a couple of exceptions,"First the good. The dishwasher is quiet, it gets the dishes clean, and they get dry enough - as dry as any other dishwasher I've had. I've done it both ways - with the pop open door mehtod and without.  Not sure if I have a preference. You may have to sop up a little water on the tops of coffee cups before unloading - but that's not out of the ordinary.
Now the less good. The ""resting"" open door position (after it pops open to dry, or if you don't close it all the way) sticks out too far from the edge of the countertop for comfort.  It's in the way. The racks are not quite designed right.  It is hard to get wine glasses, and even regular glasses to fit firmly.  They tend to fall over after loading when closing the rack. And sometimes they just fall over on their own. Same issue with loading bowls, and even plates sometimes. Because of the design of the racks, there is a lot of wasted space.  For this reason, I wish I would have purchased a KitchenAid. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]",80,"January 30, 2020"

Bosch 500 Dishwasher,"With great dread I began to shop for a new dishwasher when the 15 year old one died.  Shopping for appliances is my most unfavorite past time. Well I was in for a great surprise. I had seen the Bosch dishwashers at family homes in France.  I immediately recalled how quiet they were.  I liked the way the racks were arranged to recieve the dirty dishes.  So we immediatley decided that the replacement should be a Bosch.  I am so happy with our new Bosch 500 Series.  I like the new control panel that is hidden when closed.The third top rack is very user friendly for those special items.  Did I mention that my dishes seem cleaner?
I am very pleased in all ways with Bosch 500 dishwasher.  Thank you, Bosch for good design and engineering! [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]",100,"January 30, 2020"

Good so far,"Cleans dishes very well, very quiet and holds a lot especially when  top tray is used rather than silverware basket.  It was easy to install.   It does appear to run for a long time on some cycles but I do like the  auto opening door at the end of the cycle. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]",100,"January 30, 2020"
Quiet Excellence,"We love this dishwasher. It is really quiet and loaded with features.

The third rack is a huge improvement over the door or bottom rack baskets for utensils. It frees up more space for other dishes and they come out clean all the time. No more rewashing utensils. The adjustability of the other racks is very convenient. We are able to make every dish fit and we are able to use the space more efficiently. The AutoAir feature is great. Having the door automatically open when it is finished helps the dishes dry faster.

Did I mention it is quiet? We can run the dishwasher at anytime without affecting anyone in the house. Our last dishwasher sounded like there was construction going on in the kitchen. I sometimes forget this dishwasher is running until I see the red light on the floor. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]",100,"January 30, 2020"
Love this dishwasher!,"I'd never had a Bosch dishwasher until we moved into a 20 yo home that had what was possibly a 20 yo Bosch. Even on its last leg it cleaned better that any dishwasher I'd ever had, so when it finally gave out we had to replace it with another Bosch! This one cleans even better, has so much room, and dries better than the older model. I love the auto-air feature that pops open the door at the end of the cycle, and also the third rack for cutlery! It's definitely exceeded my expectations. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]",100,"January 30, 2020"

Outstanding Dishwasher,"It has never been easier to wash dishes.  No pre-rinsing is required at all, even though I had my doubts about this feature at the beginning.  Our dishes have never looked cleaner than they do with this machine.  It shows that we definitely needed to replace the old machine.  The glasses literally sparkle.  And it is extremely quiet.  The only noise comes from the drain when the water is expelled.  
The only complaint is that there is no way to tell if the dishes are dirty or clean.  If the machine is running, there is a light on the floor, but otherwise no indication at all from the dishwasher which is a major fault. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]",100,"January 30, 2020"

New Dishwasher,After 13 years of listening to a loud GE dishwasher I was ready to get a new one. I did a lot of research and shopping around before we decided on a Bosch. I love my new dishwasher. It holds so much more then my last dishwasher I don't have to run it as much. It uses less water and I can have it running at night while we are watching tv and not hear it. It cleans all of our dirty dishes with stuck on food that has been sitting for a few days. If you are thinking about getting a new dishwasher this is the one for you.

Truth in advertising,"This is everything they said it is: quiet, energy efficient and cleans well. It's an attractive unit. I agree with Consumer reports it's a good purchase.",100,"January 29, 2020"
So quite!!!,"I bought this dishwasher for my parents. There old one was loud and did not clean the dishes at all. This Bosch is absolutely fantastic. It cleans the dishes like nobody's business. It took a little getting used to the air drying aspect, but I will take air drying and having wicked clean dishes over element drying with dirty dishes. And this machine is superbly quite. It's so nice to actually hear the TV without having to crank the volume up to hear it, because the dishwasher is too loud. Also the room in this dishwasher is outstanding. We are able to put so much more in this dishwasher than the old one. Pots that would have never fit in the old dishwasher, fit perfectly fine in this one. Hands down this is my favorite dishwasher. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]",100,"January 29, 2020"
Great washer. Important installation issue.,"We're very pleased with our washer. We can set it to run when our electricity plan is cheapest. The auto-dry function allows room air to finish drying the load efficiently. Our only discovery is the need for a gap between the top of the unit and the underside of the counter to allow the auto dry motor to open the door. The installer did not know this, and it took 3 service calls for them to figure out this critical detail. Bosch may wish to better educate their installers and service technicians about this.

Perfect Dishwasjer,Best Dishwasher we have ever owned.  It is so quiet that it really is indicative of the reason why Bosch installed a red light that shines on the floor to let the owner know that the dishwasher is running. Also love the ability to adjust the trays and the upper dinner ware tray is a  perfect addition. Should be first on a buyer's list of dishwashers to purchase. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.],100,"January 29, 2020"
"Cleans Well, But.....","This dishwasher cleans really well and is so quiet you don't even know it is running.  However, I did encounter one problem within the first two months of owning it.  I got an error message E24.  After looking it up I found out it has something to do with the drain being clogged and also found out that many other people who have this dishwasher have the same problem.  I looked at all of the lines and found no clog and took out the filter and found no clog.  I eventually took a plunger to the bottom drain and it finally got rid of the error message.  For a brand new dishwasher I am deeply disappointed in that this happened already.  I hope this isn't a sign of future problems.  Now I make sure there are no crumbs on the dishes before I put them in. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]",80,"January 29, 2020"
Happy to be in the Bosch Family,"I'm very satisfied with my dishwasher. I have had  other brands and they couldn't come close to the Bosch dishwasher. It is so smartly made. It is the quietest machine I ever had. If not for the red light, I wouldn't know it was on. I also have a Bosch geo thermal unit and that also is the best trouble free unit I've ever had and I had quite a few. The dishwasher cleans very well too. It's Bosch for me for now on.

Best Dishwasher I've Ever Used,"After having a baby a couple months ago, I was getting tired of my previous dishwasher. It was so loud, the design was flawed where the utensil basket was in the middle of the bottom shelf (this meant you couldn't fit large pots and pans into the dishwasher) and on top of it all, it didn't clean well. Well, this dishwash is definitely the best purchase we've made so far in the past year. It's so quiet that you cannot tell it's running. I love how modular the racks are, where you can raise and lower the middle rack. There's plenty of space for pots and pans, tall glasses, cups etc. I also love that I can run a half load. I would highly recommend this dishwasher for ANYONE who dirties dishes, namely everyone. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]",100,"January 29, 2020"
Great Machine,"Best cleaning, most reliable dishwasher & best customer service ever. Best features include the top utensil rack (easy to organize which makes unloading a breeze), auto dry (brilliant and really works!), and spacing on lower rack, which works especially well with my dinner ware. 
Door is quite stiff and I cannot close it with my hip, so I wish I had gotten the protruding handle instead of the pocket handle. Annoying to have to push the off button in the morning after cycle runs. 
Lower rack could be greatly improved with 1 or 2 rows of vertical support spines along the right side since it is difficult to balance & support tall bottles and pitchers with the slanted spines. Glides on bottom rack would improve function and feel. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]",100,"January 29, 2020"
Very impressed!,This dishwasher replaced an LG.  It is far superior and we thought the LG was good.  The instructions were well written and we were able to install it ourselves in about 4 hours.

Air Dry is the Best!,"This dishwasher cleans everything, as one would expect from a Bosch.  But the real bonus is the air dry feature.  It dries better than using heat and the best part is it's much friendlier to my plastic utensils and expensive kitchen appliance parts.  I'm putting my Cuisinart bowls and La Crueset in this dishwasher without hesitation -- and I'm using less energy.  I'm really glad I bought this dishwasher.

Quiet and washes 1st time,I love the Quick 60 minute setting and when I set it in the evenings I love the auto dry cycle that opens the door automatically.  That is really fantastic for plastics.  No more wet containers & lids that have to drain further.  All round this is an amazing machine!!,100,"January 29, 2020"
It does what it claims!,"So we brought it after talking with several salespersons and all confirmed it was one of the best dishwashers on the market. This confirmed our research online. We have now had it for 6 months and we found it was living up to its repetition. We wanted one that would take care of food remains on the dishes and dispose of it, clean well, easy loading of dishes, clean every type of washable wear, dry well and we like it. It so far has lived up to its reputation. The machine has a good look and fell, easy to operate, even the husband can do it. So we are very pleased with the machine and we trust it will last more the 10 years, unlike our last one. I would highly recommend this machine. Nice work Bosch, keep it up.

Excellent Dishwasher,"This is an excellent dishwasher.  It is extremely quiet.  It gets the dishes very clean.  It's very deep and fits more dishes than our old dishwasher.  I also like the way the bottom rack is laid out.  It allows me to play ""Dishwasher Tetris"" when loading it really well by letting me place bulky pots, pans, and trays in a way that don't get in the way of the other dishes.  The only thing they can do better is with the red dot that shines on the floor to let you know it's running.  It would be nice if -- instead of just a red dot -- it displayed how much time left is in the cycle.  That's because when you close the door, all the controls are hidden.  You need SOMEthing visible outside the machine when it's running.  I highly recommend this dishwasher. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]",80,"January 29, 2020"

Best. Thing. Ever.,"This is our second Bosch (the first was lost to thirsty rodents that prefer water pumps and drain lines). We had loved our 100 series but this one surpasses our expectations. The three adjustable racks have freed up so much space, which is key when you have a family of six. Everything comes out spotless as well. The auto air (door open) feature, although certainly gimmicky, is great and allows those hard to dry plastics and coffee mugs a bit of extra time.

"Works wonderfully, bigger than i thought","Love it! So far everything gets clean.  ALL our dishes fit which is nice since we have weird ones: bowl-like giant plates, thick stoneware, plastic cereal bowl, everything fits. As a family of 5 we can go 2-3 days now between running it, too, which is a change from the daily cycle of our old maytag. Reasons I gave it a 4 vs 5: 1) its quiet but not super-quiet (the light to indicate it's on is ridiculous, you can hear it), 2) adding rinse aid is a pain to avoid 'air holes', 3) you have to manually 'power off' after running a cycle 4) you have to select 'auto air' each time you run it, which kids forget.  No major drawbacks, but little annoyances. Definitely would buy again. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]",80,"January 29, 2020"

Pluses and minuses: my new dishwasher,"It's very quiet, and generally does a good cleaning job.  It takes a very long time when set at ""auto"" (when the machine's sensors determine how long to wash and rinse), ""sanitize"" (which heats the load more than normal), and ""air"" (opens the door and prolongs blowing in order to fully dry the dishes)--this setting takes 3 hours and 48 minutes.  It has no heating element, unlike my old Asko dishwasher, which in general (I believe) did a better job in less time. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]",80,"January 29, 2020"

It was easy to install and It does a good job of cleaning the dishes but it doesn't dry as well as the KitchenAid. That's okay, it's not too bad. The real fault is in the rack design. Each dishwasher is a puzzle where you have to figure out the best way to stack your dishes, but this is a puzzle with missing peices in that the rack designs for both the bottom and top don't seem well conceived and it's very hard to get dishes and large pans in the same load.

Best dishwasher ever owned !,"This d/w is sooo quiet I have a hard time knowing it's running!! Thankfully it emits a red light near the bottom showing you it's on. Absolutely LOVE the compartments and how clean it leaves the dishes!!! Literally, squeaky clean. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]",100,"January 29, 2020"
German engineering at its Best!,"Dishes come out sparkling clean. I am mainly using the 'auto' function. But even the delicate cycle cleans set stains, so that was impressive. Didn't think I'd use the third rack on top but it actually frees up a lot of space in the silverwear compartment which is very nice. Adjusting the height of the second rack is simple and practical at times. 
The only thing I'd wish would be an option is for the silverwear compartment on the bottom rack to be movable. I'd love to be able to place it along the front for easy access. Just a thought though. Excellent machine. Love my Bosch! [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]",100,"January 29, 2020"
Dishwasher review after 8 weeks,"This dishwasher has met all of my expectations. It is very quiet and cleans well. When the dishwasher is running or is ready to start, there is a red dot that is displayed on the floor. Lots of rack space with the third rack. Can also move the second rack up or down depending on the size of the dishes to be washed. Would buy again. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]",100,"January 29, 2020"
Outstanding,Our salesperson highly recommended the Bosch and everything he said was accurate.  Superior cleaning ability.  Large capacity with the silverware tray.  So quiet.  Very pleased with our decision. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.],100,"January 29, 2020"
Bosch dishwasher,This replaced a dishwasher that was only 4 months old. I thought I would replace with my white Bosch dishwasher with a stainless one but a different manufacturer. I was so disappointed in the quality of the other dishwasher that my husband replaced that one with a new Bosch stainless dishwasher. I learned a lesson.  Stick with the Bosch reputation. It's worth paying a few more dollars [This review was collected as part of a promotion.],100,"January 29, 2020"
Best Gift to myself ever,"I recently purchased the 500 series Bosch disnhwasher and I could not be happier with the machine.  I use the recommended products Quantum Finish and get great results.  This dishwasher is extremely quiet and the red light projection on the floor is a great feature.  Sometimes I forget it is running because it is so quiet.  I love that the door does not ""drop down"" when you open it.  The third drawer is awesome for small stuff - I use those little bowls for snacks And the top shelf is ideal. My dishes come out dry every time. No spots on glasses.  This machine delivers on all its features.  So glad I purchased it.  It looks so elegant in our kitchen. 
I would definitely recommend this machine.   I did a lot of research,reading reviews and comparisons among other brands and didn't hesitate in purchasing the Bosch 500 series.  I would definitely purchase other Bosch appliances [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]",100,"January 29, 2020"

Washes really well! Get it!,"Pros:
- The dishwasher washes very well, no prerinse required
- Super quiet

Cons:
- Does not dry dishes. This could be a good thing if you don't want the dishwasher to apply a ton of heat on your dishes (which should make them last longer).
- Cycles take a long time. This could be a good thing too since it's taking its time to get everything clean. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]",100,"January 29, 2020"

Awesome dishwasher,This dishwasher is very quiet (indicates its on by a red light beaming on the floor) and does what is intended.  Its cleans dishes very well.

It seems to work just great for us, at least after the first month of owning it. It is so quiet as to be almost creepy---you just hear the water move about or an occasional moving pan. That is wonderful! 
We'll have to see how it holds up with our highly mineralized well water, of course. To date it cleans well, so long as we add vinegar to the rinse cycle.
Our one complaint is that the instructions are not in plain English but rather are done with pictorial ""cartoons."" Some folks like that; we don't. It would be very helpful to have some words, not just pictures that may or may not be clear.",100,"January 22, 2020"

Great features on this dishwasher,"I bought this dishwasher a couple months ago on the recommendation of the man who was trying to fix my old dishwasher and I am very glad I did. 
I read many reviews prior to buying and here are some thoughts.  
I always wash overnight as suggested so that everything dries well. 
I always use finish/jet dry for spot free
I read reviews of bad smells:  once a month add white vinegar to a dish less wash to keep fat cleared out of tubes (told to by repairman)
Once a month clean the bottom screen out. 
I leave slightly ajar all the time because there is water in the bottom screen and want to avoid funky smells people reported. So far so good. Of course it is very quiet too. 
I love the top rack for spatulas and I think the washer is laid out nicely. I would recommend it to everyone.",100,"January 21, 2020"
Wet Dishes No Matter What,"This is definitely a quiet dishwasher and is energy efficient. However, it has absolutely NO DRYING feature and the auto air setting makes no difference at all. I can run it with auto air in the evening and if I unload the next morning I must have a dishtowel handy, especially for the silverware. We replaced an inexpensive 13 year old contract grade dishwasher and the dishes are no cleaner than before. Very disappointed.",20,"January 20, 2020"

My husband picked this out, not realizing that Bosch believes dishwashers don't need to have a dry feature. Seriously....who wants to dry dishes before putting them away, especially silverware.

I have tried every setting including the auto air feature which pops the door open. But, regardless of how much time passes, even overnight, the silverware is wet and so is most everything else. We are highly dissatisfied with this dishwasher!!!!",20,"January 14, 2020"
